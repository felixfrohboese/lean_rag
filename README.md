# Easy RAG

## AI-powered Q&A Assistant for Private Docs
            
### What does Easy RAG do?
Easy RAG will process your uploaded text files (txt format), create a vector database from them and allow you to ask questions about it using the chat interface.

            
### How to use it:
- **Step 1 | Input Parameters**: Provide your OpenAI API along with potential changes to the pre-selected parameters for the solution. By hovering about the info sign of each input field, you get more context. 
- **Step 2 | Upload Files**: Upload your text files, check the list of files and click on the "Process Files" button to trigger the creation of an individual vector database for those files.
- **Step 3 | Ask Questions**: Ask questions about the content of the uploaded files in the Chat interface.
- **Important Note**: All inputs are saved in the session state, so you don't have to re-input them unless you want to change something. They will however be deleted once you close the app.

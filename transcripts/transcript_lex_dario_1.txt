00:00 Speaker 3: If you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right? If, if you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level. And last year we were at undergraduate level and the year before we were at like the level of a high school student. Again, you can, you can quibble with at what tasks and for what we're still missing modalities, but those are being added, like computer use was added, like image generation has been added, if you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027, I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in, in a hundred years, those were the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing. We are rapidly running out of truly convincing blockers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years, the scale up is very quick. Like we do this today. We make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of instances of it. I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size where you'll be able to deploy millions of these, I am optimistic about meaning. I worry about economics and the concentration of power. That's actually what I worry about more, the abuse of power.

01:14 Speaker 4: And AI increases the amount of power in the world. And if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable damage.

01:23 Speaker 3: Yes. It's very frightening. It's very, it's very frightening.

01:27 Speaker 4: The following is a conversation with Dario Amadei, CEO of Anthropic, the company that created Claude, that is currently and often at the top of most LLM benchmark leaderboards. On top of that, Dario and the Anthropic team have been outspoken advocates for taking the topic of AI safety very seriously, and they have continued to publish a lot of fascinating AI research on this and other topics. I'm also joined afterwards by two other brilliant people from Anthropic. First, Amanda Askel, who is a researcher working on alignment and fine -tuning of Claude, including the design of Claude's character and personality. A few folks told me she has probably talked with Claude more than any human at Anthropic. So she was definitely a fascinating person to talk to about prompt engineering and practical advice on how to get the best out of Claude. After that, Chris Ola stopped by for a chat. He's one of the pioneers of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is an exciting set of efforts that aims to reverse engineer neural networks to figure out what's going on inside, inferring behaviors from neural activation patterns inside the network. This is a very promising approach for keeping future super intelligent AI systems safe. For example, by detecting from the activations, when the model is trying to deceive the human it is talking to. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Dario Amadei. Let's start with the big idea of scaling laws and the scaling hypothesis. What is it? What is its history? And where do we stand today?

03:22 Speaker 3: So I can only describe it as it, you know, as it relates to kind of my own experience, but I've been in the AI field for about 10 years and it was something I noticed very early on. So I first joined the AI world when I was working at Baidu with Andrew Ng in late 2014, which is almost exactly 10 years ago now. And the first thing we worked on was speech recognition systems. And in those days, I think deep learning was a new thing. It had made lots of progress, but everyone was always saying, we don't have the algorithms we need to succeed. You know, we're not, we're only matching the tiny, tiny fraction. There's so much we need to kind of discover algorithmically. We haven't found the picture of how to match the human brain. And when, you know, in some ways it was fortunate, I was kind of, you know, you can have almost beginner's luck, right? I was like a newcomer to the field. And, you know, I looked at the neural net that we were using for speech, the recurrent neural networks. And I said, I don't know, what if you make them bigger and give them more layers? And what if you scale up the data along with this, right? I just saw these as, as like independent dials that you could turn. And I noticed that the model started to do better and better as you gave them more data, as you, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer. And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but, but along with, with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform. And so initially my thinking was, Hey, maybe that is just true for speech recognition systems, right? Maybe, maybe that's just one particular quirk, one particular area. I think it wasn't until 2017, when I first saw the results from GPT -1, that it clicked for me that language is probably the area in which we can do this. We can get trillions of words of language data. We can train on them. And the models we were trained in those days were tiny. You could train them on one to eight GPUs. Whereas, you know, now we train jobs on tens of thousands, soon going to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. And so when I, when I saw those two things together and, you know, there were a few people like Ilya Sutskever, who you've interviewed, who had somewhat similar views, right? He might've been the first one, although I think a few people came to, came to similar views around the same time, right? There was, you know, Rich Sutton's bitter lesson, there was, Gorin wrote about the scaling hypothesis, but I think somewhere between 2014 and 2017 was when it really clicked for me when I really got conviction that, Hey, we're going to be able to do these incredibly wide cognitive tasks if we just, if we just scale up the models. And at every stage of scaling, there are always arguments. And, you know, when I first heard them, honestly, I thought probably I'm the one who's wrong. And, you know, all these, all these experts in the field are right. They know the situation better, better than I do. Right. There's, you know, the Chomsky argument about like, you can get syntactics, but you can't get semantics. There was this idea, Oh, you can make a sentence make sense, but you can't make a paragraph make sense. The latest one we have today is. Uh, you know, we're going to run out of data or the data isn't high quality enough or models can't reason. And each time, every time we managed to, we managed to either find a way around or scaling just is the way around. Um, sometimes it's one, sometimes it's the other. Uh, and, and so I'm now at this point, I, I still think, you know, it's, it's, it's always quite uncertain. We have nothing but inductive inference to tell us that the next few years are going to be like the next, the last 10 years, but, but I've seen, I've seen the movie enough times. I've seen the story happen for, for enough times to, to really believe that probably the scaling is going to continue and that there's some magic to it that we haven't really explained on a theoretical basis yet.

07:10 Speaker 4: And of course the scaling here is bigger networks, bigger data, bigger compute. Yes.

07:17 Speaker 3: All of those in particular, linear scaling up of bigger networks, bigger training times, and, uh, more and more data. Uh, so all of these things, almost like a chemical reaction, you know, you have three ingredients in the chemical reaction and you need to linearly scale up the three ingredients. If you scale up one, not the others, you run out of the other reagents and the, and the reaction stops. But if you scale up everything, everything in series, then, then the reaction can proceed.

07:45 Speaker 4: And of course, now that you have this kind of empirical science slash art, you can apply it to other, uh, more nuanced things like scaling laws applied to interpretability or scaling laws applied to post -training or just seeing how does this thing scale? But the big scaling law, I guess the underlying scaling hypothesis has to do with big networks. Big data leads to intelligence. Yeah.

08:10 Speaker 3: We've, we've documented scaling laws in lots of domains other than language, right? So, uh, initially the, the paper we did that first showed it was in early 2020 where we first showed it for language. There was then some work late in 2020 where we showed the same thing for other modalities like images, video, text to image, image to text, math, that they all had the same pattern. And, and you're right. Now there are other stages like post -training or there are new types of reasoning models. And in, in, in all of those cases that we've measured, we see similar, similar types of scaling laws.

08:48 Speaker 4: A bit of a philosophical question, but what's your intuition about why bigger is better in terms of network size and data size? Why does it lead to more intelligent models?

09:00 Speaker 3: So in my previous career as a, as a biophysicist, so I did physics undergrad and then biophysics in, in, in, in grad school. So I think back to what I know as a physicist, which is actually much less than what some of my colleagues at Anthropic have in terms of, in terms of expertise in physics, uh, there's this, there's this concept called the one over F noise and one over X distributions, um, where we're often, um, uh, you know, just, just like if you add up a bunch of natural processes, you get a Gaussian. If you add up a bunch of kind of differently distributed natural processes, if you like, if you like, take a, take a, um, probe and, and hook it up to a resistor. The distribution of the thermal noise and the resistor goes as one over the frequency. Um, it's some kind of natural convergent distribution. Uh, and, and I, I, I, and, and I think what it amounts to is that if you look at a lot of things that are, that are produced by some natural process that has a lot of different scales, right. Not a Gaussian, which is kind of narrowly distributed, but, you know, if I look at kind of like large and small fluctuations that lead to lead to electrical noise, um, they have this decaying one over X distribution. And so now I think of like patterns in the physical world, right. If I, if, or, or in language, if I think about the patterns in language, there are some really simple patterns. Some words are much more common than others like the, then there's basic noun, verb structure. Then there's the fact that, you know, nouns and verbs have to agree. They have to coordinate and there's the higher level sentence structure. Then there's the thematic structure of paragraphs. And so the fact that there's this regressing structure, you can imagine that as you make the networks larger, first, they capture the really simple correlations, the really simple patterns. And there's this long tail of other patterns. And if that long tail of other patterns is really smooth, like it is with the one over F noise in, you know, physical processes like, like, like, like resistors, then you can imagine as you make the network larger, it's kind of capturing more and more of that distribution. And so that smoothness gets reflected in how well the models are at predicting that how well they perform. Language is an evolved process, right? We've, we've developed language. We have common words and less common words. We have common expressions and less common expressions. We have ideas, cliches that are expressed frequently, and we have novel ideas. And that process has, has developed, has evolved with humans over millions of years. And so the, the, the guess, and this is pure speculation would be, would be that there is, there's some kind of long tail distribution of, of, of the distribution of these ideas.

11:41 Speaker 4: So there's the long tail, but also there's the height of the hierarchy of concepts that you're building up. So the bigger the network, presumably you have a higher capacity to.

11:51 Speaker 3: Exactly. If you have a small network, you only get the common stuff, right? If, if I take a tiny neural network, it's very good at understanding that, you know, a sentence has to have, you know, verb, adjective, noun, right? But it's, it's terrible at deciding what those verb, adjective, and noun should be and whether they should make sense. If I make it just a little bigger, it gets good at that. Then suddenly it's good at the sentences, but it's not good at the paragraphs. And so these, these rarer and more complex patterns get picked up as I add, as I add more capacity to the network.

12:20 Speaker 4: Well, the natural question then is what's the ceiling of this? Yeah. Like how complicated and complex is the real world? How much is the stuff is there to learn?

12:30 Speaker 3: I don't think any of us knows the answer to that question. Um, I S my strong instinct would be that there's no ceiling below the level of humans, right? We humans are able to understand these various patterns. And so that, that makes me think that if we continue to, you know, scale up these, these, these models to kind of develop new methods for training them and scaling them up, uh, that will at least get to the level that we've gotten to with humans, there's then a question of, you know, how much more is it possible to understand that humans do? How much, how much is it possible to be smarter and more perceptive than humans? I, I would guess the answer has, has got to be domain dependent. If I look at an area like biology and, you know, I wrote this essay machines of loving grace. It seems to me that humans are struggling to understand the complexity of biology, right? If you go to Stanford or to Harvard or to Berkeley, you have whole departments of, you know, folks trying to study, you know, like the immune system or metabolic pathways. And, and each person understands only a tiny bit, part of it specializes and they're struggling to combine their knowledge with that of, with that of other humans, and so I have an instinct that there's, there's a lot of room at the top for AI's to get smarter. If I think of something like materials in the, in the physical world, or, you know, um, like addressing, you know, conflicts between humans or something like that, I mean, you know, it may be, there's only some of these problems are not intractable, but much harder. And, and it may be that there's only, there's only so well you can do with some of these things, right? Just like with speech recognition, there's only so clear I can hear your speech. So I think in some areas there may be ceilings in, in, you know, that are very close to what humans have done in, in other areas, those ceilings may be very far away. And I think we'll only find out when we build these systems, uh, there's, it's very hard to know in advance. We can speculate, but we can't be sure.

14:26 Speaker 4: And in some domains, the ceiling might have to do with human bureaucracies and things like this, as you write about. Yeah. So humans fundamentally have to be part of the loop. That's the cause of the ceiling, not maybe the limits of the intelligence. Yeah.

14:38 Speaker 3: I think in many cases, um, you know, in theory, technology could change very fast. For example, all the things that we might invent with respect to biology. Um, but remember there's, there's a, you know, there's a clinical trial system that we have to go through to actually administer these things to humans. I think that's a mixture of things that are unnecessary and bureaucratic and things that kind of protect the integrity of society and the whole challenge is that it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell what's going on, uh, it's hard to tell which is which right. My, my view is definitely, I think in terms of drug development, we, my view is that we're too slow and we're too conservative, but certainly if you get these things wrong, you know, it's, it's possible to, to, to risk people's lives by, by being, by being, by being too reckless. And so at least, at least some of these human institutions are in fact protecting people. So it's, it's all about finding the balance. I strongly suspect that balance is kind of more on the side of pushing to make things happen faster, but there is a balance.

15:39 Speaker 4: If we do hit a limit, if we do hit a slowdown in the scaling laws, what do you think would be the reason? Is it compute limited, data limited? Uh, is it something else? Ideal limited?

15:51 Speaker 3: So a few things now we're talking about hitting the limit before we get to the level of, of humans and the skill of humans. Um, so, so I think one that's, you know, one that's popular today. And I think, you know, could be a limit that we run into. I like most of the limits I would bet against it, but it's definitely possible is we simply run out of data. There's only so much data on the internet and there's issues with the quality of the data, right? You can get hundreds of trillions of words on the internet, but a lot of it is, is repetitive or it's search engine, you know, search engine optimization, drivel, or maybe in the future it'll even be text generated by AIs itself. Uh, and, and so I think there are limits to what, to, to, to what can be produced in this way. That said, we, and I would guess other companies are working on ways to make data synthetic, uh, where you can, you know, you can use the model to generate more data of the type that you have, that you have already, or even generate data from scratch. If you think about, uh, what was done with, uh, DeepMind's AlphaGo Zero, they managed to get a bot all the way from, you know, no ability to play Go whatsoever to above human level, just by playing against itself. There was no example data from humans required in the, the AlphaGo Zero version of it. The other direction of course, is these reasoning models that do chain of thought and stop to think, um, and, and reflect on their own thinking. In a way that's another kind of synthetic data coupled with reinforcement learning. So my, my guess is with one of those methods, we'll get around the data limitation, or there may be other sources of data that are, that are available. Um, we could just observe that even if there's no problem with data, as we start to scale models up, they just stop getting better. It's, it seemed to be a reliable observation that they've gotten better. That could just stop at some point for a reason we don't understand. Um, the answer could be that we need to, uh, you know, we need to invent some new architecture. Um, it's been, there have been problems in the past with, with say numerical stability of models where it looked like things were, were leveling off. But, but actually, you know, when we, when we, when we found the right unblocker, they didn't end up doing so. So perhaps there's new, some new optimization method or some new, uh, technique we need to, to unblock things. I've seen no evidence of that so far, but if things were to, to slow down, that perhaps could be one reason.

18:15 Speaker 4: What about the limits of compute? Meaning, uh, the expensive, uh, nature of building bigger and bigger data centers.

18:23 Speaker 3: So right now I think, uh, you know, most of the frontier model companies I would guess are, are operating in, you know, roughly, you know, $1 billion scale plus or minus a factor of three, right? Those are the models that exist now or are being trained now. Uh, I think next year we're going to go to a few billion and then, uh, 2026, we may go to, uh, uh, you know, above 10, 10, 10 billion and probably by 2027, their ambitions to build a hundred, a hundred billion dollar, a hundred billion dollar clusters. And I think all of that actually will happen. There's a lot of determination to build the compute, to do it within this country, uh, and I would guess that it actually does happen now, if we get to a hundred billion, that's still not enough compute, that's still not enough scale, then either we need even more scale or we need to develop some way of doing it more efficiently of shifting the curve. Um, I think between all of these, one of the reasons I'm bullish about powerful AI happening so fast is just that if you extrapolate the next few points on the curve, we're very quickly getting towards human level ability, right? Some of the new models that, that we developed some, some reasoning models that have come from other companies, they're starting to get to what I would call the PhD or professional level, right? If you look at their, their coding ability, um, the latest model we released, Sonnet 3 .5, the new or updated version, it gets something like 50 % on Swebench and Swebench is an example of a bunch of professional real world software engineering tasks. At the beginning of the year, I think the state of the art was three or 4%. So in 10 months, we've gone from 3 % to 50 % on this task. And I think in another year we'll probably be at 90%. I mean, I don't know, but might, might even be, might even be less than that. Uh, we've seen similar things in graduate level, math, physics, and biology from models like OpenAI's O1. Uh, so, uh, if we, if we just continue to extrapolate this right in terms of skill, skill that we have, I think if we extrapolate the straight curve within a few years, we will get to these models being, you know, above the highest professional level in terms of humans. Now, will that curve continue? You've pointed to, and I've pointed to a lot of reasons why, you know, possible reasons why that might not happen. But if the, if the extrapolation curve continues, that is the trajectory we're on.

20:46 Speaker 4: So Anthropic has several competitors. It'd be interesting to get your sort of view of it all. OpenAI, Google, XAI, Meta. What does it take to win in the broad sense of win in the space? Yeah.

20:58 Speaker 3: So I want to separate out a couple of things, right? So, you know, Anthropic's, Anthropic's mission is to kind of try to make this all go well. Right. And, and, you know, we have a theory of change called race to the top, right? Race to the top is about trying to push the other players to do the right thing by setting an example. It's not about being the good guy. It's about setting things up so that all of us can be the good guy. I'll give a few examples of this. Early in the history of Anthropic, one of our co -founders, Chris Ola, who I believe you're, you're interviewing soon. You know, he's the co -founder of the field of mechanistic interpretability, which is an attempt to understand what's going on inside AI models. So we had him and one of our early teams focus on this area of interpretability, which we think is good for making models safe and transparent. For three or four years that had no commercial application whatsoever. It still doesn't today. We're doing some early betas with it and probably it will eventually, but you know, this is a very, very long research bet and one in which we've, we've built in public and shared our results publicly. And, and we did this because, you know, we think it's a way to make models safer. And interesting thing is that as we've done this, other companies have started doing it as well. In some cases, because they've been inspired by it in some cases, because they're worried that, uh, you know, if, if other companies are doing this, that look more responsible, they want to look more responsible too. No one wants to look like the irresponsible actor. And, and so they adopt this, they adopt this as well. When folks come to Anthropic, interpretability is often a draw. And I tell them the other places you didn't go, tell them why you came here. Um, and, and then you see soon that there, that there's interpretability teams else elsewhere as well. And in a way that takes away our competitive advantage, because it's like, oh, now others are doing it as well, but it's good, it's good for the broader system. And so we have to invent some new thing that we're doing that others aren't doing as well, and the hope is to basically bid up, bid up the importance of, of, of doing the right thing. And it's not, it's not about us in particular, right? It's not about having one particular good guy. Other companies can do this as well. If they, if they, if they join the race to do this, that's, that's, you know, that's the best news ever. Right. Um, uh, it's, it's just, it's about kind of shaping the incentives to point upward instead of shaping the incentives to point, to point downward.

23:25 Speaker 4: And we should say this example of the field of, uh, mechanistic interpretability is just a, a rigorous non hand wavy way of doing AI safety. Or it's tending that way.

23:36 Speaker 3: Trying to, I mean, I think we're still early, um, in terms of our ability to see things. But I've been surprised at how much we've been able to look inside these systems and understand what we see. Right. Unlike with the scaling laws, where it feels like there's some, you know, law that's deriving these models to perform better on, on the inside, the models aren't, you know, there's no reason why they should be designed for us to understand them. Right. They're designed to operate. They're designed to work just like the human brain or human biochemistry. They're not designed for a human to open up the hatch, look inside and understand them. But we have found, and you know, you can talk in much more detail about this to Chris, that when we open them up, when we do look inside them, we find things that are surprisingly interesting.

24:20 Speaker 4: And as a side effect, you also get to see the beauty of these models. You get to explore the sort of the beautiful nature of large neural networks through the McInturb kind of methodology.

24:29 Speaker 3: I'm amazed at how clean it's been. I'm amazed at things like induction heads. I'm amazed at things like, you know, that, that we can, you know, use sparse auto -encoders to find these directions within the networks. And that the directions correspond to these very clear concepts. We demonstrated this a bit with the Golden Gate Bridge claud. So this was an experiment where we found a direction inside one of the neural networks layers that corresponded to the Golden Gate Bridge. And we just turned that way up. And so we released this model as a demo. It was kind of half a joke for a couple of days. But it was, it was illustrative of the method we developed. And you could, you could take the Golden Gate, you could take the model, you could ask it about anything, you know, you know, it would be like, how you could say, how was your day? And anything you asked, because this feature was activated, it would connect to the Golden Gate Bridge. So it would say, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling relaxed and expansive, much like the arches of the Golden Gate Bridge, or, you know,

25:31 Speaker 4: it would masterfully change topic to the Golden Gate Bridge and integrate it. There was also a sadness to it, to, to the focus ahead on the Golden Gate Bridge. I think people quickly fell in love with it. I think so people already miss it because it was taken down. I think after a day,

25:45 Speaker 3: somehow these interventions on the model, um, where, where, where, where you kind of adjust its behavior, somehow emotionally made it seem more human than any other version of the model, strong personality, strong identity, strong personality. It has these kind of like obsessive interests. You know, we can all think of someone who's like obsessed with something. So it does make it feel somehow a bit more human. Let's talk about the present.

26:09 Speaker 4: Let's talk about Claude. So this year, a lot has happened in March. Claude III, Opus, Sonnet, Haiku were released. Then Claude III, V, Sonnet in July with an updated version just now released. And then also Claude III, V, Haiku was released. Okay. Can you explain the difference between Opus, Sonnet and Haiku and how we should think about the different versions? Yeah.

26:35 Speaker 3: So let's go back to March when we first released these three models. So, you know, our thinking was, you know, different companies produce kind of large and small models, better and worse models, we felt that there was demand both for a really powerful model. You know, when you, that might be a little bit slower that you'd have to pay more for, and also for fast, cheap models that are as smart as they can be for how fast and cheap, right. Whenever you want to do some kind of like, you know, difficult analysis. Like if I, you know, I want to write code for instance, or, you know, I want to, I want to brainstorm ideas or I want to do creative writing. I want the really powerful model. But then there's a lot of practical applications in a business sense where it's like, I'm interacting with a website. I, you know, like I'm like doing my taxes or I'm, you know, talking to a, you know, to like a legal advisor and I want to analyze a contract or, you know, we have plenty of companies that are just like, you know, I, you know, I want to do autocomplete on my, on my IDE or something. And, and for all of those things, you want to act fast and you want to use the model very broadly. So we wanted to serve that whole spectrum of needs. So we ended up with this, you know, this kind of poetry theme. And so what's a really short poem. It's a haiku. And so haiku is the small, fast, cheap model that is, you know, was at the time was really surprisingly, surprisingly intelligent for how fast and cheap it was. Sonnet is a, is a medium sized poem, right? A couple of paragraphs. And so Sonnet was the middle model. It is smarter, but also a little bit slower, a little bit more expensive. And, and Opus like a Magnum Opus is a large work. Opus was the, the largest, smartest model at the time. So that, that was the original kind of thinking behind it. And our, our thinking then was, well, each new generation of models should shift that trade -off curve. So when we released Sonnet 3 .5, it has the same, roughly the same, you know, cost and speed as the Sonnet 3 model. But it, it increased its intelligence to the point where it was smarter than the original Opus 3 model, especially for code, but, but also just in general. And so now, you know, we've shown results for a haiku 3 .5 and I believe haiku 3 .5, the smallest new model is about as good as Opus 3, the largest old model. So basically the aim here is to shift the curve. And then at some point there's going to be an Opus 3 .5. Now, every new generation of models has its own thing. They use new data, their personality changes in ways that we kind of, you know, try to steer, but are not fully able to steer. And, and so there's never quite that exact equivalence where the only thing you're changing is intelligence. Um, we always try and improve other things and some things change without us, without us knowing or measuring. So it's, it's very much an exact science. In many ways, the manner and personality of these models is more an art than it is a science.

29:44 Speaker 4: So what is sort of the reason for, uh, the span of time between say, uh, cloud Opus 3 .0 and 3 .5? What is it, what takes that time if you can speak to it? Yeah.

29:58 Speaker 3: So there's, there's different, there's different, uh, processes. Um, uh, there's pre -training, which is, you know, just kind of the normal language model training, and that takes a very long time, um, that uses, you know, these days, you know, tens, you know, tens of thousands, sometimes many tens of thousands of, uh, GPUs or TPUs or Tranium or, you know, we use different platforms, but you know, accelerator chips, um, often, often training for months. Uh, there's then a kind of post -training phase where we do reinforcement learning from human feedback, as well as other kinds of reinforcement learning that, that phase is getting, uh, larger and larger now. And, you know, you know, often that's less of an exact science. It often takes effort to get it right. Um, models are then tested with some of our early partners to see how good they are and they're then tested both internally and externally for their safety, particularly for catastrophic and autonomy risks. Uh, so, uh, we do internal testing according to our responsible scaling policy, which I, you know, could talk more about that in detail. And then we have an agreement with the US and the UK AI Safety Institute, as well as other third party testers in specific domains to test the models for what are called CBRN risks, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, which are, you know, we don't think that models pose these risks seriously yet, but, but every new model we want to evaluate to see if we're starting to get close to some of these, these, these more dangerous, um, uh, these more dangerous capabilities. So those are the phases. And then, uh, you know, then, then it just takes some time to get the model working in terms of inference and launching it in the API. So there's just a lot of steps to, uh, to actually, to actually making a model work. And of course, you know, we're always trying to make the processes as streamlined as possible, right? We want our safety testing to be rigorous, but we want it to be rigorous and to be, you know, to be automatic, to happen as fast as it can without compromising on rigor. Same with our pre -training process and our post -training process. So, you know, it's just like building anything else. It's just like building airplanes. You want to make them, you know, you want to make them safe, but you want to make the process streamlined. And I think the creative tension between those is, is, you know, is an important thing in making the models work. Yeah.

32:21 Speaker 4: A rumor on the street, I forget who was saying that, uh, Anthropic has really good tooling. So I, uh, probably a lot of the challenge here is on the software engineering side is to build the tooling to, to have a, like a efficient, low friction interaction with the infrastructure.

32:36 Speaker 3: You would be surprised how much of the challenges of, uh, you know, building these models comes down to, you know, software engineering, performance engineering, you know, you, you, you know, from the outside, you might think, oh man, we had this Eureka breakthrough, right. You know, this movie with the science, we discovered it, we figured it out. But, but, but I think, I think all things, even, even, even, you know, incredible discoveries, like they, they, they, they, they almost always come down to the details, um, and, and often super, super boring details. I can't speak to whether we have better tooling than, than other companies. I mean, you know, haven't been at those other companies, at least, at least not recently. Um, but it's certainly something we give a lot of attention to.

33:19 Speaker 4: I don't know if you can say, but from three, from cloud three to cloud three, five, is there any extra pre -training going on as they mostly focus on the post -training? There's been leaps in performance.

33:29 Speaker 3: Yeah, I think, I think at any given stage, we're focused on improving everything at once. Um, just, just naturally, like there are different teams, each team makes progress in a particular area in, in, in making a particular, you know, their particular segment of the relay race better, and it's just natural that when we make a new model, we put, we put all of these things in at once.

33:50 Speaker 4: So the data you have, like the preference data you get from RLHF, is that applicable, is there ways to apply it to newer models as it gets trained up?

34:00 Speaker 3: Yeah, preference data from old models sometimes gets used for new models. Although of course, uh, it, it performs somewhat better when it's, you know, trained on, it's trained on the new models. Note that we have this, you know, constitutional AI method such that we don't only use preference data. We kind of, there's also a post -training process where we train the model against itself. And there's, you know, new types of post -training the model against itself that are used every day. So it's not just RLHF, it's a bunch of other methods as well. Um, post -training, I think, you know, is becoming more and more sophisticated.

34:30 Speaker 4: Well, what explains the big leap in performance for the new SONNET 3 .5? I mean, at least in the programming side, and maybe this is a good place to talk about benchmarks. What does it mean to get better? Just the number went up, but you know, I, I, I program, but I also love programming and I, um, CLAW 3 .5 through cursor is what I use, uh, to assist me in programming. And there was, at least experientially, anecdotally, it's gotten smarter, uh, at programming. So what, like what, what does it take to get it, uh, to get it smarter?

35:03 Speaker 3: We observed that as well, by the way, there were a couple of very strong engineers here at Anthropic, um, who all previous code models, both produced by us and produced by all the other companies, hadn't really been useful to, hadn't really been useful to them. You know, they said, you know, maybe, maybe this is useful to beginner. It's not useful to me, but SONNET 3 .5, the original one for the first time, they said, oh my God, this helped me with something that, you know, that it would have taken me hours to do. This is the first model has actually saved me time. So again, the waterline is rising. And, and then I think, you know, the new SONNET has been, has been even better in terms of what it, what it takes. I mean, I'll just say it's been across the board. It's in the pre -training, it's in the post -training, it's in various evaluations that we do. We've observed this as well. And if we go into the details of the benchmark, so SWE Bench is basically, you know, since, since, you know, since, since you're a programmer, you know, you'll be familiar with like pull requests and, you know just, just pull requests or like the, you know, the, like a sort of, a sort of atomic unit of work. You know, you could say, I'm, you know, I'm implementing one, I'm implementing one thing. And, and so SWE Bench actually gives you kind of a real world situation where the code base is in the current state and I'm trying to implement something that's, you know, that's described in, described in language. We have internal benchmarks where we, where we measure the same thing. And you say, just give the model free reign to like, you know, do anything, run, run, run anything, edit anything. How, how well is it able to complete these tasks? And it's that benchmark that's gone from, it can do it 3 % of the time to it can do it about 50 % of the time. So I actually do believe that if we get, you can gain benchmarks, but I think if we get to a hundred percent on that benchmark and in a way that isn't kind of like over -trained or, or, or game for that particular benchmark probably represents a real and serious increase in kind of, in kind of programming, programming ability, and I would suspect that if we can get to, you know, 90, 90, 95 % that, that, that, that, you know, it will, it will represent ability to autonomously do a significant fraction of software engineering tasks.

37:14 Speaker 4: Well, ridiculous timeline question. Uh, when is GLADOPUS, uh, 3 .5 coming up?

37:19 Speaker 3: Uh, not giving an exact date, uh, but you know, they're, they're, uh, you know, as far as we know, the plan is still to have a CLAWD 3 .5 OPUS.

37:28 Speaker 4: Are we going to get it before GTA six or no?

37:30 Speaker 3: Like Duke Nukem forever.

37:31 Speaker 4: So what was that game that there was some game that was delayed 15 years, was that Duke Nukem forever?

37:36 : Yeah.

37:36 Speaker 4: And I think GTA is now just releasing trailers.

37:39 Speaker 3: It, you know, it's only been three months since we released the first sonnet. Yeah.

37:42 Speaker 4: It's incredible. The incredible pace of release.

37:44 Speaker 3: It just, it just tells you about the pace, the expectations for when things are going to come out.

37:49 Speaker 4: So, uh, what about 4 .0? So how do you think about sort of as these models get bigger and bigger about versioning and also just versioning in general, why sonnet 3 .5 updated with the date, why not sonnet 3 .6, which a lot of people calling it.

38:06 Speaker 3: Naming is actually an interesting challenge here, right? Because I think a year ago, most of the model was pre -training. And so you could start from the beginning and just say, okay, we're going to have models of different sizes. We're going to train them all together. And, you know, we'll have a, a family of naming schemes and then we'll put some new magic into them. And then, you know, we'll have the next, the next generation. Um, the trouble starts already when some of them take a lot longer than others to train, right. That already messes up your time time a little bit, but as you make big improvements in, as you make big improvements in pre -training, uh, then you suddenly notice, oh, I can make better pre -trained model and that doesn't take very long to do. And, but, you know, clearly it has the same, you know, size and shape of previous models. Uh, uh, so I think those two together, as well as the timing, timing issues, any kind of scheme you come up with, uh, you know, the reality tends to kind of frustrate that scheme, right? It tends to kind of break out of the breakout of the scheme. It's not like software where you can say, oh, this is like, you know, 3 .7, this is 3 .8. No, you have models with different, different trade -offs. You can change some things in your models. You can train, you can change other things. Some are faster and slower at inference. Some have to be more expensive. Some have to be less expensive. And so I think all the companies have struggled with this. Um, I think we did very, you know, I think, think we were in a good, good position in terms of naming when we had Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus. Great start. We're trying to maintain it, but it's not, it's not, it's not perfect. Um, so we'll, we'll, we'll try and get back to the simplicity, but it, it, um, uh, just the, the, the nature of the field, I feel like no one's figured out naming. It's somehow a different paradigm from like normal software. And, and, and so we, we just, none of the companies have been perfect at it. Um, it's something we struggle with surprisingly much relative to, you know, how, relative to how trivial it is, you know, for the, the, the, the grand science of training the models.

40:03 Speaker 4: So from the user side, the user experience of the updated Sonnet 3 .5 is just different than the previous, uh, June, 2024 Sonnet 3 .5. It would be nice to come up with some kind of labeling that embodies that because people talk about Sonnet 3 .5, but now there's a different one. And so how do you refer to the previous one and the new one? And it, it, uh, when there's a distinct improvement, it just makes conversation about it, uh, just challenging. Yeah.

40:35 Speaker 3: Yeah. I, I definitely think this question of there are lots of properties of the models that are not reflected in the benchmarks. Um, I, I think, I think that's, that's definitely the case and everyone agrees. And not all of them are capabilities. Some of them are, you know, models can be polite or brusque. They can be, uh, you know, uh, very reactive or they can ask you questions. Um, they can have what, what feels like a warm personality or a cold personality. They can be boring or they can be very distinctive like GoldenGate Claude was. Um, and we have a whole, you know, we have a whole team kind of focused on, I think we call it Claude character. Uh, Amanda leads that team and we'll, we'll talk to you about that, but it's still a very inexact science. Um, and, and often we find that models have properties that we're not aware of. The, the fact of the matter is that you can, you know, talk to a model 10 ,000 times, and there are some behaviors you might not see, uh, just like, just like with a human, right? I can know someone for a few months and, you know, not know that they have a certain skill or not know that there's a certain side to them. And so I think, I think we just have to get used to this idea. And we're always looking for better ways of testing our models to, to demonstrate these capabilities and, and, and also to decide which are, which are the, which are the personality properties we want models to have in which we don't want to have. That itself, the normative question is also super interesting.

42:02 Speaker 4: I got to ask you a question from Reddit, from Reddit.

42:05 Speaker 3: Oh boy.

42:07 Speaker 4: You know, there there's just this fascinating to me, at least it's a psychological social phenomenon where people report that Claude has gotten dumber for them over time. And so, uh, the question is, does the user complaint about the dumbing down of Claude three, five sonnet hold any water? So are these anecdotal reports a kind of social phenomena or did Claude, is there any cases where Claude would get dumber?

42:33 Speaker 3: So, uh, this actually doesn't apply. This, this isn't just about Claude. I believe this, I believe I've seen these complaints for every foundation model produced by a major company. Um, people said this about GPT -4, they said it about GPT -4 turbo. Um, so, so, so a couple things. Um, one, the actual weights of the model, right? The actual brain of the model that does not change unless we introduce a new model. Um, there, there are just a number of reasons why it would not make sense practically to be randomly substituting in, substituting in new versions of the model is difficult from an inference perspective, and it's actually hard to control all the consequences of changing the weights of the model. Let's say you wanted to fine tune the model to be like, I don't know, to like, to say certainly less, which, you know, an old version of sonnet used to do. Um, you actually end up changing a hundred things as well. So we have a whole process for it. And we have a whole process for modifying the model. We do a bunch of testing on it. We do a bunch of, um, like we do a bunch of user testing and early customers. So it, we both have never changed the weights of the model without, without telling anyone. And it wouldn't certainly in the current setup, it would not make sense to do that. Now, there are a couple of things that we do occasionally do. Um, one is sometimes we run AB tests. Um, but those are typically very close to when a model is being, is being, uh, released and for a very small fraction of time. Um, so, uh, you know, like the, you know, the, the day before the new sonnet 3 .5, I agree, we should have had a better name. It's clunky to refer to it. Um, there were some comments from people that like, it's got, it's got, it's gotten a lot better and that's because, you know, a fraction we're exposed to, to an AB test for, for those one or for those one or two days. Um, the other is that occasionally the system prompt will change, um, on the system prompt can have some effects, although it's on, it's unlikely to dumb down models, it's unlikely to make them dumber. Um, and, and, and, and we've seen that while these two things, which I'm listing to be very complete, um, happened relatively happened quite infrequently. Um, the complaints about, uh, for us and for other model companies about the model change, the model isn't good at this, the model got more censored. The model was dumbed down. Those complaints are constant. And so I don't want to say like people are imagining it or anything, but like the models are for the most part, not changing. Um, if I were to offer a theory, um, I, I think it actually relates to one of the things I said before, which is that models have many are very complex and have many aspects to them. And so often, you know, if I, if I, if I, if I ask the model a question, you know, if I'm like, if I'm like do task X versus can you do task X, the model might respond in different ways. Uh, and, and so there are all kinds of subtle things that you can change about the way you interact with the model that can give you very different results. Um, to be clear, this, this itself is like a failing by, by us and by the other model providers that, that the models are, are just, just often sensitive to like small, small changes in wording. It's yet another way in which the science of how these models work is very poorly developed. Uh, and, and so, you know, if I go to sleep one night and I was like talking to the model in a certain way, and I like slightly change the phrasing of how I talk to the model, you know, I could, I could get different results. So that's, that's one possible way. The other thing is, man, it's just hard to quantify this stuff. Uh, it's hard to quantify this stuff. I think people are very excited by new models when they come out. And then as time goes on, they, they become very aware of the, they become very aware of the limitations. So that may be another effect, but that's, that's all a very long rendered way of saying for the most part, with some fairly narrow exceptions, the models are not changing.

46:22 Speaker 4: I think there is a psychological effect. You just start getting used to it. The baseline raises, like when people have first gotten wifi on airplanes, it's like amazing magic. Yeah. And then, and then you start getting this thing to work.

46:35 Speaker 2: This is such a piece of crap.

46:37 Speaker 4: Exactly. So then it's easy to have the conspiracy theory of they're making wifi slower and slower. This is probably something I'll talk to Amanda much more about, but, um, another Reddit question. Uh, when will Claude stop trying to be my, uh, puritanical grandmother imposing its moral worldview on me as a paying customer? And also what is the psychology behind making Claude overly apologetic? So this kind of reports about the experience, a different angle on the frustration. It has to do with the character. Yeah.

47:06 Speaker 3: So a couple of points on this first one is, um, like things that people say on Reddit and Twitter or X or whatever it is, um, there's actually a huge distribution shift between like the stuff that people complain loudly about on social media and what actually kind of like, you know, statistically users care about, and that drives people to use the models, like people are frustrated with, you know, things like, you know, the model, not writing out all the code or the model, uh, you know, just, just not being as good at code as it could be, even though it's the best model in the world on code. Um, I, I think the majority of things, of things are about that. Um, uh, but, uh, certainly a, a, a kind of vocal minority are, uh, you know, kind of, kind of, kind of raised these concerns, right. Are frustrated by the model, refusing things that it shouldn't refuse or like apologizing too much, or just, just having these kinds of like annoying verbal ticks. Um, the second caveat, and I just want to say this like super clearly, because I think it's like, some people don't know it, others like kind of know it, but forget it, like it is very difficult to control across the board, how the models behave, you cannot just reach in there and say, oh, I want the model to like, apologize less, like you can do that. You can include trading data that says like, oh, the model should like apologize less, but then in some other situation, they end up being like super rude or like overconfident in a way that's like misleading people. So there, there are all these trade -offs. Um, uh, for example, another thing is if there was a period during which models ours, and I think others as well, were too verbose, right. They would like repeat themselves. They would say too much. Um, you can cut down on the verbosity by penalizing the models for, for just talking for too long. What happens when you do that, if you do it in a crude way is when the models are coding, sometimes they'll say, rest of the code goes here, right. Because they've learned that that's a way to economize and that they see it. And then, and then, so that leads the model to be so -called lazy encoding, where they, where they, where they're just like, ah, you can finish the rest of it. It's not, it's not because we want to, you know, save on compute or because, you know, the models are lazy and, you know, during winter break or any of the other kinds of conspiracy theories that have, that have, that have come up, it's actually, it's just very hard to control the behavior of the model, to steer the behavior of the model in all circumstances. At once you can kind of, there's this, this whack -a -mole aspect where you push on one thing and like, you know, these, these, these, you know, these other things start to move as well that you may not even notice or measure. And so one of the reasons that I, that I care so much about, uh, you know, kind of grand alignment of these AI systems in the future is actually, these systems are actually quite unpredictable. They're actually quite hard to steer and control. Um, and this version we're seeing today of you make one thing better, it makes another thing worse. Uh, I think that's, that's like a present day analog of future control problems in AI systems that we can start to study today, right? I think, I think that, that, that difficulty in, in steering the behavior and in making sure that if we push an AI system in one direction, it doesn't push it in another direction in some, in some other ways that we didn't want. Uh, I think that's, that's kind of an, that's kind of an early sign of things to come and if we can do a good job of solving this problem, right, of like you ask the model to like, you know, to like make and distribute smallpox and it says no, but it's willing to like help you in your graduate level virology class. Like, how do we get both of those things at once? It's hard. It's very easy to go to one side or the other, and it's a multidimensional problem. And so, uh, I, you know, I think these questions of like shaping the model's personality. I think they're very hard. I think we haven't done perfectly on them. I think we've actually done the best of all the AI companies, but still so far from perfect. Uh, and I think if we can get this right, if we can control the, the, you know, control the false positives and false negatives in this, this very kind of controlled present day environment, we'll be much better at doing it for the future. When our worry is, you know, will the models be super autonomous? Will they be able to, you know, make very dangerous things? Will they be able to autonomously, you know, build whole companies and are those companies aligned? So, so I, I think of this, this present task as both vexing, but also good practice for the future.

51:40 Speaker 4: What's the current best way of gathering sort of user feedback? Like, uh, not anecdotal data, but just large scale data about. Pain points or the opposite of pain points, positive things. So on, is it internal testing? Is it a specific group testing, AB testing? What, what, what works?

51:58 Speaker 3: So, so typically, um, we'll have internal model bashings where all of anthropic. Anthropic is almost a thousand people. Um, you know, people just, just try and break the model. They try and interact with it various ways. Um, uh, we have a suite of evals, uh, for, you know, oh, is the model refusing in ways that it couldn't. I think we even had a certainly eval because you know, our, our model, again, one point model had this problem where like it had this annoying tick where it would like respond to a wide range of questions by saying, certainly I can help you with that. Certainly. I would be happy to do that. Certainly this is correct. Um, uh, and so we had a, like certainly eval, which is like, how, how often does the model say certainly, uh, uh, but, but look, this is just a whack -a -mole like, like what if it switches from certainly to definitely like, uh, uh, so, you know, every time we add a new eval and we're, we're always evaluating for all of the old things. So we have hundreds of these evaluations, but we find that there's no substitute for human interacting with it. And so it's very much like the ordinary product development process. We have like hundreds of people within Anthropic bash the model. Then we do, uh, you know, then we do externally be tests. Sometimes we'll run tests with contractors. We pay contractors to interact with the model. Um, so you put all of these things together and it's still not perfect. You still see behaviors that you don't quite want to see, right. You know, you see, you still see the model, like refusing things that it just doesn't make sense to refuse. Um, but I, I, I think trying to trying to solve this challenge, right. Trying to stop the model from doing, you know, genuinely bad things that, you know, know what everyone agrees it shouldn't do, right. You know, everyone, everyone, you know, everyone agrees that, you know, the model shouldn't talk about, you know, I, I don't know, child abuse material. Right. Like everyone agrees the model shouldn't do that. Uh, but, but at the same time that it doesn't refuse in these dumb and stupid ways, uh, I think, I think drawing, drawing that line as finally as possible approaching perfectly is still, is still a challenge and we're getting better at every day, but there's, there's a lot to be solved. And again, I would point to that as, as an indicator of a challenge ahead in terms of steering much more powerful models, do you think Claude 4 .0 is ever

54:10 Speaker 4: coming out?

54:11 Speaker 3: I don't want to commit to any naming scheme. Cause if I say, if I say here, we're going to have Claude for next year. And then, and then, you know, then we decide that like, you know, we should start over because there's a new type of model. Like, I, I, I don't want to, I don't want to commit to it. I would expect in a normal course of business that Claude 4 .0 would come after Claude 3 .5, but, but, you know, you know, you never know in this wacky field, right? But, uh, sort of this idea of scaling is continuing. Scale, scaling is continuing. There, there will definitely be more powerful models coming from us than the models that exist today. That is, that is certain, or if there, if there aren't, we've, we've deeply failed as a company. Okay.

54:49 Speaker 4: Can you explain the responsible scaling policy and the AI safety level standards, ASL levels?

54:55 Speaker 3: As much as I'm excited about the benefits of these models. And we know we'll talk about that. If we talk about machines of loving grace, um, I'm, I'm worried about the risks and I continue to be worried about the risks, uh, no one should think that, you know, machines of loving grace was me, me saying, uh, you know, I'm no longer worried about the risks of these models. I think they're two sides of the same coin. The, the, uh, power of the models and their ability to solve all these problems in, you know, biology, neuroscience, economic development, government governance, and peace, large parts of the economy, those, those come with risks as well, right? With great power comes great responsibility, right? That's the, the two are, the two are paired, uh, things that are powerful can do good things and they can do bad things. Um, I think of those risks as, as being in, you know, several different, different categories. Perhaps the two biggest risks that I think about, and that's not to say that there aren't risks today that are, that are important, but when I think of the really, the, the, you know, the things that would happen on the grandest scale, um, one is what I call catastrophic misuse. These are misuse of the models in domains like cyber bio radiological nuclear, right, things that could, you know, that could harm or even kill thousands, even millions of people, if they really, really go wrong, um, like these are the, you know, number one priority to prevent. And, and here I would just make a simple observation, which is that. My, the models, you know, if, if I look today at people who have done really bad things in the world, um, uh, I think actually humanity has been protected by the fact that the overlap between really smart, well -educated people and people who want to do really horrific things has generally been small. Like, you know, let's say, let's say I'm someone who, you know, I, you know, I have a PhD in this field. I have a well -paying job. Um, there's so much to lose. Why do I want to like, you know, even, even assuming I'm completely evil, which, which most people are not, um, why, why, you know, why would such a person risk their risk, their, you know, risk their life, rich risk, their, their legacy, their reputation to, to do something like, you know, truly, truly evil, if we had a lot more people like that, the world would be a much more dangerous place. And so my, my, my worry is that by being a, a much more intelligent agent, AI could break that correlation. And so I, I, I, I do have serious worries about that. I believe we can prevent those worries. Uh, but you know, I, I think as a counterpoint to machines of loving grace, I want to say that this is the, I, there's still serious risks. And, and the second range of risks would be the autonomy risks, which is the idea that models might on their own, particularly as we give them more agency than they've had in the past, uh, particularly as we give them supervision over wider tasks, like, you know, writing whole code bases or someday even, you know, effectively operating entire, entire companies, they're on a long enough leash, are they, are they doing what we really want them to do? It's very difficult to even understand in detail what they're doing, let alone, let alone control it. And like I said, this, these early signs that it's, it's hard to perfectly draw the boundary between things the model should do and things the model shouldn't do that, that, you know, if you go to one side, you get things that are annoying and useless, and you go to the other side, you get other behaviors. If you fix one thing, it creates other problems. We're getting better and better at solving this. I don't think this is an unsolvable problem. I think this is a, you know, this is a science like, like the safety of airplanes or the safety of cars or the safety of drugs. I, you know, I, I don't think there's any big thing we're missing. I just think we need to get better at controlling these models. And so these are, these are the two risks I'm worried about and our responsible scaling plan, which all recognizes a very long winded answer to your question, our responsible scaling plan is designed to address these two types of risks. And so every time we develop a new model, we basically test it for its ability to do both of these bad things. So if I were to back up a little bit, I think we have, I think we have an interesting dilemma with AI systems where they're not yet powerful enough to present these catastrophes. I don't know that, I don't know that they'll ever present, prevent these catastrophes, it's possible they won't, but the, the case for worry, the case for risk is strong enough that we should, we should act now and, and they're, they're getting better very, very fast. Right. I, you know, I testified in the Senate that, you know, we might have serious bio risks within two to three years. That was about a year ago. Things have preceded, preceded a pace. Uh, so we have this thing where it's like, it's, it's, it's surprisingly hard to, to address these risks because they're not here today. They don't exist. They're like ghosts, but they're coming at us so fast because the models are improving so fast. So how do you deal with something that's not here today, doesn't exist, but is coming at us very fast? Uh, so the solution we came up with for that in, in collaboration with, uh, you know, people like, uh, the organization meter and Paul Cristiano is okay, what, what, what you need for that are you need tests to tell you when the risk is getting close? You need an early warning system. And, and so every time we have a new model, we test it for its capability to do these CBRN tasks, as well as testing it for, you know, how capable it is of doing tasks autonomously on its own. And, uh, in the latest version of our RSP, which we released in the last, in the last month or two, uh, the way we test autonomy risks is the model, the AI models ability to do. Aspects of AI research itself, uh, which when the model, when the AI models can do AI research, they become kind of truly, truly autonomous. Uh, and that, you know, that threshold is important for a bunch of other ways. And, and so what do we then do with these tasks? The RSP basically develops what we've called an if then structure, which is if the models pass a certain capability, then we impose a certain set of safety and security requirements on them. So today's models are what's called ASL two models that were ASL one is for systems that manifestly don't pose any risk of autonomy or misuse. So for example, a chess playing bot, deep blue would be ASL one. It's just manifestly the case that you can't use deep blue for anything other than chess. It was just designed for chess. No, one's going to use it to like, you know, to conduct a masterful cyber attack or to, you know, run wild and take over the world. ASL two is today's AI systems where we've measured them and we think these systems are simply not smart enough to, to, you know, autonomously self -replicate or conduct a bunch of tasks and also not smart enough to provide meaningful information about CBRN risks and how to build CBRN weapons above and beyond what can be known from looking at Google in fact, sometimes they do provide information, but, but not above and beyond a search engine, but not in a way that can be stitched together. Not, not in a way that kind of end to end is dangerous enough. So ASL three is going to be the point at which the models are helpful enough to enhance the capabilities of non -state actors, right? State actors can already do a lot, a lot of, unfortunately to a high level of proficiency, a lot of these very dangerous and destructive things. The difference is that non -state, non -state actors are not capable of it. And so when we get to ASL three, we'll take special security precautions designed to be sufficient to prevent theft of the model by non -state actors and misuse of the model as it's deployed. We'll have to have enhanced filters targeted at these particular areas. Cyber, bio, nuclear. Cyber, bio, nuclear, and model autonomy, which is less a misuse risk and more risk of the model doing bad things itself. ASL four, getting to the point where these models could, could enhance the capability of a, of a, of a already knowledgeable state actor and, or become the, you know, the main source of such a risk, like if you wanted to engage in such a risk, the main way you would do it is through a model. And then I think ASL four on the autonomy side, it's, it's some, some, some amount of acceleration in AI research capabilities with an, with an AI model. And then ASL five is where we would get to the models that are, you know, that are, that are kind of, that are kind of, you know, truly capable that it could exceed humanity in their ability to do, to do any of these tasks. And so the, the, the point of the, if then structure commitment is, is basically to say, look, I don't know, I've been, I've been working with these models for many years and I've been worried about risk for many years, it's actually kind of dangerous to cry wolf. It's actually kind of dangerous to say this, that, you know, this, this model is, this model is risky and, you know, people look at it and they say, this is manifestly not dangerous. Again, it's, it's, it's the, the delicacy of the risk isn't here today, but it's coming at us fast. How do you deal with that? It's, it's really vexing to a risk planner to deal with it. And so this, if then structure basically says, look, we don't want to antagonize a bunch of people. We don't want to harm our own, you know, our, our, our kind of own ability to have a place in the conversation by imposing these, these very onerous burdens on models that are not dangerous today. So the, if then the trigger commitment is basically a way to deal with that. It says you clamp down hard when you can show that the model is dangerous. And of course, what has to come with that is, you know, enough of a buffer threshold that, that, you know, you can, you can, uh, you, you know, you're, you're, you're not at high risk of kind of missing the danger. It's not a perfect framework. We've had to change it every, every, uh, you know, we came out with a new one just a few weeks ago and probably, probably going forward, we might release new ones multiple times a year because it's, it's hard to get these policies. Right. Like technically organizationally from a research perspective, but that is the proposal, if then commitments and triggers in order to minimize burdens and false alarms now, but really react appropriately when the dangers are here.

01:05:37 Speaker 4: What do you think the timeline for ASL three is where several of the triggers are fired and what do you think the timeline is for ASL four? Yeah.

01:05:45 Speaker 3: So that is hotly debated within the company. Um, uh, we are working actively to prepare ASL three, uh, security, uh, security measures, as well as ASL three deployment measures. Um, I'm not going to go into detail, but we've made, we've made a lot of progress on both and, you know, we're, we're prepared to be, I think ready quite soon. Uh, I would, I would not be surprised. I would not be surprised at all. If we hit ASL three, uh, next year, there was some concern that we, we might even hit it, uh, uh, this year. That's still, that's still possible. That could still happen. It's like very hard to say, but like, I would be very, very surprised if it was like 2030. Uh, I think it's much sooner than that.

01:06:25 Speaker 4: So there's a protocols for detecting it if then, and then there's protocols for how to respond to it. Yes. How difficult is the second, the latter?

01:06:34 Speaker 3: Yeah, I think for ASL three, it's primarily about security. Um, and, and about, you know, filters on the model relating to a very narrow set of areas when we deploy the model, because at ASL three, the model isn't autonomous yet. Um, uh, and, and so you don't have to worry about, you know, kind of the model itself behaving in a bad way, even when it's deployed internally. So I think the ASL three measures are, are, I won't say straightforward. They're, they're, they're, they're rigorous, but they're easier to reason about. I think once we get to ASL four, um, we start to have worries about the models being smart enough that they might sandbag tests, they might not tell the truth about tests. Um, we had some results came out about like sleeper agents, and there was a more recent paper about, you know, can, can the models, uh, uh, mislead attempts to, you know, sandbag their own abilities, right. Show them, you know, uh, uh, uh, present themselves as being less capable than they are. And so I think with ASL four, there's going to be an important component of using other things than just interacting with the models, for example, interpretability or hidden chains of thought, uh, where you have to look inside the model and verify via some other mechanism that, that is not, you know, is not as easily corrupted as what the model says, uh, that, that, you know, that, that, that the model indeed has some property. Uh, so we're still working on ASL four. One of the properties of the RSP is that we, we don't specify ASL four until we've hit ASL three. Be, and I think that's proven to be a wise decision because even with ASL three, it, again, it's hard to know this stuff in detail and, and it, it, we want to take as much time as we can possibly take to get these things right.

01:08:23 Speaker 4: So for ASL three, the bad actor will be the humans humans. Yes. And so there's a little bit more, um, for ASL four, it's both, I think it's both. And so deception and that's where mechanistic interpretability comes into play and hopefully the techniques used for that are not made accessible to the model. Yeah.

01:08:42 Speaker 3: I mean, of course you can hook up the mechanistic interpretability to the model itself, um, but then you've, then you, then you've kind of lost it as a reliable indicator of, uh, of, uh, of, of, of the model state, there are a bunch of exotic ways you can think of that. It might also not be reliable. Like if the model gets smart enough that it can like, you know, jump computers and like read the code where you're like looking at its internal state. We've thought about some of those. I think they're exotic enough. There are ways to render them unlikely, but yeah, generally you want to, you want to preserve mechanistic interpretability as a kind of verification set or test set that's separate from the training process of the model.

01:09:19 Speaker 4: See, I think, uh, as these models become better and better conversation and become smarter, social engineering becomes a threat too, because they, they can start being very convincing to the engineers inside companies. Oh yeah.

01:09:31 Speaker 3: Yeah. It's actually like, you know, we've, we've seen lots of examples of demagoguery in our life from humans. And, and, you know, there's a concern that models could do that. Could do that as well.

01:09:41 Speaker 4: One of the ways that cloud has been getting more and more powerful is it's now able to do some agentic stuff, um, computer use, uh, there's also an analysis within the sandbox of cloud .ai itself, but let's talk about computer use. That's seems to me, super exciting that you can just give cloud a task and it, uh, it takes a bunch of actions, figures it out and is access to the, your computer through screenshots. So can you explain how that works? Uh, and where that's headed.

01:10:10 Speaker 3: Yeah, it's actually relatively simple. So cloud has, has had for a long time, since, since cloud three back in March, the ability to analyze images and respond to them with text, the, the only new thing we added is those images can be screenshots of a computer and in response, we train the model to give a location on the screen where you can click and, or buttons on the keyboard, you can press in order to take action. And it turns out that with actually not all that much additional training, the models can get quite good at that task. It's a good example of generalization. Um, you know, people sometimes say, if you get to low earth orbit, you're like halfway to anywhere, right? Because of how much it takes to escape the gravity. Well, if you have a strong pre -trained model, I feel like you're halfway to anywhere, uh, in, in terms of, in terms of the intelligence space, uh, uh, and, and, and so actually it didn't, it didn't take all that much to get, to get Claude to do this and you can just set that in a loop, give the model a screenshot, tell it what to click on, give it the next screenshot, tell it what to click on, and, and that turns into a full kind of almost, almost 3d video interaction of the model. And it's able to do all of these tasks, right? You know, we, we showed these demos where it's able to like fill out spreadsheets. It's able to kind of like interact with a website. It's able to, you know, um, You know, it's able to open all kinds of, you know, different operating systems, windows, Linux, Mac, uh, uh, so, uh, you know, I think all of that is very exciting. I will say while in theory, there's nothing you could do there that you couldn't have done through just giving the model, the API to drive the computer screen, uh, this really lowers the barrier. And, you know, there's, there's, there's a lot of folks who, who, who either, you know, kind of, kind of aren't, aren't, you know, aren't in a position to, to interact with those APIs or it takes them a long time to do. It's just, the screen is just a universal interface. That's a lot easier to interact with. And so I expect over time, this is going to lower a bunch of barriers. Now, honestly, the current model has, there's, there, it leaves a lot still to be desired, and we were, we were honest about that in the blog, right? It makes mistakes, it misclicks. And we, we, you know, we were careful to warn people, Hey, this thing isn't, you can't just leave this thing to, you know, run on your computer for minutes and minutes. Um, You got to give this thing boundaries and guardrails. And I think that's one of the reasons we released it first in an API form rather than kind of, you know, this, this kind of just, just hand it, just hand it to the consumer and, and give it control of their, of their, of their, of their computer. Um, but, but, you know, I definitely feel that it's important to get these capabilities out there as models get more powerful. We're going to have to grapple with, you know, how do we use these capabilities safely? How do we prevent them from being abused? Uh, and, and, you know, I think, I think releasing, releasing the model while, while the capabilities are, are, you know, are, are still, are still limited is, is, is very helpful in terms of, in terms of doing that. Um, you know, I think since it's been released a number of customers, I think, uh, Repl .it was maybe, was maybe one of the, the, the most, uh, quickest, quickest, quickest, uh, quickest to deploy things, um, have, have, you know, have made use of it in various ways. People have hooked up demos for, you know, Windows desktops, Macs, uh, uh, you know, Linux, Linux machines. Uh, so yeah, it's been, it's been, it's been very exciting. I think as with, as with anything else, you know, it, it, it comes with new, exciting abilities. And then, then, then, you know, then, then with those new exciting abilities, we have to think about how to, how to, you know, make the model, you know, safe, reliable, do what humans want them to do. I mean, it's the same, it's the same story for everything, right? Same thing. It's that same tension.

01:13:51 Speaker 4: But, but the possibility of use cases here is just the, the range is incredible. So, uh, how much to make it work really well in the future? How much do you have to specially kind of, uh, go beyond what's the pre -trained models doing? Do more post -training, RLHF or supervised fine tuning or synthetic data just for the agent?

01:14:10 Speaker 3: Yeah, I think speaking at a high level, it's our intention to keep investing a lot in, you know, making, making the model better. Uh, like I think, I think, uh, you know, we look at, look at some of the, you know, some of the benchmarks where previous models were like, oh, it could do it 6 % of the time. And now our model would do it 14 or 22 % of the time. And yeah, we want to get up to, you know, the human level reliability of 80, 90%, just like anywhere else. Right. We're on the same curve that we were on with SWEBench where I think I would guess a year from now, the models can do this very, very reliably, but you got to start somewhere.

01:14:41 Speaker 4: So you think it's possible to get to the, the human level 90%, uh, basically doing the same thing you're doing now, or is it has to be special for computer use?

01:14:49 Speaker 3: I mean, uh, it depends what you mean by, by, you know, special and special in general, um, but, but I, you know, I, I generally think, you know, the same kinds of techniques that we've been using to train the current model. I expect that doubling down on those techniques in the same way that we have for code, for code, for models in general, for other kit, for, you know, for image input, um, uh, you know, for voice, uh, I expect those same techniques will scale here as they have everywhere else.

01:15:18 Speaker 4: But this is giving sort of the power of action to Claude. And so you could do a lot of really powerful things, but you could do a lot of damage also. Yeah.

01:15:27 Speaker 3: Yeah. No. And we've been very aware of that. Look, my, my view actually is computer use isn't a fundamentally new capability like the CBRN or autonomy capabilities are, um, it's more like it kind of opens the aperture for the model to use and apply its existing abilities. Uh, and, and so the way we think about it, going back to our RSP is nothing that this model is doing inherently increases, you know, the risk from an RSP, RSP perspective, but as the models get more powerful, having this capability may make it scarier once it, you know, once it has the cognitive capability to, um, you know, to do something at the ASL three and ASL four level, this, this, you know, this may be the thing that kind of unbounds it from doing so, so going forward, certainly this modality of interaction is something that we have tested for, and that we will continue to test for an RSP going forward. Um, I think it's probably better to have, to learn and explore this capability before the model is super, uh, you know, super capable.

01:16:33 Speaker 4: Yeah. And there's a lot of interesting attacks like prompt injection, because now you've widened the aperture so you can prompt inject through stuff on screen. So if this becomes more and more useful, then there's more and more benefit to inject, inject stuff into the model. If it goes to a certain web page, it could be harmless stuff like advertisements, or it could be like harmful stuff. Right. Yeah.

01:16:53 Speaker 3: I mean, we've thought a lot about things like spam, CAPTCHA, you know, mass camp. There's all, you know, every, every like, if one secret I'll tell you, if you've invented a new technology, not necessarily the biggest misuse, but, but the, the first misuse you'll see scams, just petty scams, like you'll just, just, just, it's, it's like, it's like a thing as old people scamming each other. It's, it's this, it's this thing as old as time. Um, and, and, and it's just every time you got to deal with it.

01:17:22 Speaker 4: It's almost like silly to say, but it's, it's true. Sort of bots and spam in general is a thing. As it gets more and more intelligent, it's uh, it's just, there are a lot of, like,

01:17:32 Speaker 3: like I said, like there are a lot of petty criminals in the world and, and, and, you know, it's like every new technology is like a new way for petty, petty criminals to do something, you know, something stupid and malicious.

01:17:45 Speaker 4: Uh, is there any ideas about sandboxing it? Like how difficult is the sandboxing task?

01:17:50 Speaker 3: Yeah, we sandbox during training. So for example, during training, we didn't expose the model to the internet. Um, I think that's probably a bad idea during training because, uh, you know, the model can be changing its policy. It can be changing what it's doing and it's having an effect in the real world. Um, uh, you know, in, in terms of actually deploying the model, right. It kind of depends on the application. Like, you know, sometimes you want the model to do something in the real world, but of course you can always put guard, you can always put guardrails on the outside, right? You can say, okay, well, you know, this model's not going to move data from my, you know, model's not going to move any files from my computer or my web server to anywhere else. Now, when you talk about sandboxing, again, when we get to ASL four, none of these precautions are going to make sense there, right? Where, when you, when you talk about ASL four, you're then the model is being kind of, you know, you're, there's a theoretical worry, the model could be smart enough to break it, to, to kind of break out of any box. And so there, we need to think about mechanistic interpretability about, you know, if we're, if we're going to have a sandbox, it would need to be a mathematically provable sound, but you know, that's, that's a whole different world than what we're dealing with with the models today. Yeah.

01:19:02 Speaker 4: The science of building a box from which, uh, ASL four AI system cannot escape.

01:19:08 Speaker 3: I think it's probably not the right approach. I think the right approach, instead of having something, you know, unaligned that, that like you're trying to prevent it from escaping, I think it's, it's better to just design the model the right way or have a loop where you, you know, you look inside, you look inside the model and you're able to verify properties. And that gives you a, an opportunity to like iterate and actually get it right. Um, I think, I think containing, uh, containing bad models is, is, is much worse solution than having good models.

01:19:36 Speaker 4: Let me ask you about regulation. What's the role of regulation in keeping AI safe? So for example, can you describe California AI regulation bill SB 1047 that was ultimately vetoed by the governor? What are the pros and cons of this bill?

01:19:50 Speaker 3: Yeah, we ended up making some suggestions to the bill and then some of those were adopted and, you know, we felt, I think, I think quite positively, uh, uh, quite positively about, about the bill, uh, by, by the end of that, um, it did still have some downsides, um, uh, and you know, of course, of course it got vetoed. Um, I think at a high level, I think some of the key ideas behind the bill, um, are, you know, I would say similar to ideas behind our RSPs, and I think it's very important that some jurisdiction, whether it's California or the federal government and or other, other countries and other states passes some regulation like this. And I can talk through why I think that's so important. So I feel good about our RSP. It's not perfect. It needs to be iterated on a lot, but it's been a good forcing function for getting the company to take these risks seriously, to put them into product planning, to really make them a central part of work at Anthropic and to make sure that all of a thousand people, and it's almost a thousand people now at Anthropic understand that this is one of the highest priorities of the company, if not the highest priority. Uh, but one, there are, there are still some companies that don't have RSP like mechanisms, like open AI, Google, uh, did adopt these mechanisms a couple of months after, uh, after Anthropic did. Uh, but there are, there are other companies out there that don't have these mechanisms at all. Uh, and so if some companies adopt these mechanisms and others don't, uh, it's really going to create a situation where, you know, some of these dangers have the property that it doesn't matter if three out of five of the companies are being safe, if the other two are, are being, are being unsafe, it creates this negative externality. And, and I think the lack of uniformity is not fair to those of us who have put a lot of effort into being very thoughtful about these procedures. The second thing is I don't think you can trust these companies to adhere to these voluntary plans in their own, right? I like to think that Anthropic will, we do everything we can that we will. Our, our, our, our RSP is checked by our long -term benefit trust. Uh, so, you know, we do everything we can to, to, to adhere to our own RSP. Um, but you know, you hear lots of things about various companies saying, oh, they said they would do, they said they would give this much compute and they didn't, they said they would do this thing and they didn't, um, you know, I don't, I don't think it makes sense to, you know, to, to, to, you know, litigate particular things that companies have done, but I think this, this broad principle that like, if there's nothing watching over them, there's nothing watching over us as an industry, there's no guarantee that we'll do the right thing and the stakes are very high. Uh, and so I think it's, I think it's important to have a uniform standard that, that, that, that, that everyone follows and to make sure that simply that the industry does what a majority of the industry has already said is important and has already said that they definitely will do right. Some people, uh, you know, I think there's, there's a class of people who are against regulation on principle. I understand where that comes from. If you go to Europe and, you know, you see something like GDPR, you see some of the other stuff that, that, that, that, that, that, that they've done, you know, some of it's good, but, but some of it is really unnecessarily burdensome and I think it's fair to say really has slowed, really has slowed innovation. And so I understand where people are coming from on priors. I understand why people come from, start from that, start from that position. Uh, but, but again, I think AI is different. If we go to the very serious risks of autonomy and misuse that, that, that I talked about, you know, just, uh, just a few minutes ago, I think that those are unusual and they weren't an unusually strong response. Uh, and so I, I think it's very important. Again, um, we need something that everyone can get behind. Uh, you know, I think one of the issues with SB 10 47, uh, especially the original version of it was it, it had a bunch of the structure of RSPs, but it also had a bunch of stuff that was either clunky or that, that, that just would have created a bunch of burdens, a bunch of hassle, and might even have missed the target in terms of addressing the risks, um, you don't really hear about it on Twitter, you just hear about kind of, you know, people are, people are cheering for any regulation. And then the folks who are against make up these often quite intellectually dishonest arguments about how, you know, it, you know, it'll make us move away from California. Bill, Bill doesn't apply. If you're headquartered in California, bill only applies if you do business in California. Um, or that it would damage the open source ecosystem or that it would, you know, it would cause, cause all of these things. I, I think those were mostly nonsense, but there are better arguments against regulation. There's one guy, uh, Dean Ball, who's really, you know, I think a very scholarly, scholarly analyst who, who looks at what happens when a regulation is put in place and ways that they can kind of get a life of their own or how they can be poorly designed. And so our interest has always been, we do think there should be regulation in this space, but we want to be an actor who makes sure that that, that, that, that regulation is something that's surgical, that's targeted at the serious risks and is something people can actually comply with because something I think the advocates of regulation don't understand as well as they could is if we get something in place that is, um, that's poorly targeted, that wastes a bunch of people's time, what's going to happen is people are going to say, see these safety risks there, you know, this is, this is nonsense. I just, you know, I just had to hire 10 lawyers to, to, you know, to fill out all these forms. I had to run all these tests for something that was clearly not dangerous. And after six months of that, there will be, there will be a groundswell and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll end up with a durable consensus against regulation. And so the, I, I think the, the worst enemy of those who want real accountability is badly designed regulation. Um, we, we need to actually get it right. Uh, and, and this is, if there's one thing I could say to the advocates, it would be that I want them to understand this dynamic better and we need to be really careful and we need to talk to people who actually have, who actually have experience seeing how regulations play out in practice and, and the people who have seen that understand to be very careful. If this was some lesser issue, I might be against regulation at all. But what, what I want the opponents to understand is, is that the underlying issues are actually serious. They're, they're not, they're not something that I or the other companies are just making up because of regulatory capture, they're not sci -fi fantasies. They're not, they're not any of these things. Um, you know, every, every time we have a new model, every few months, we measure the behavior of these models and they're getting better and better at these concerning tasks, just as they are getting better and better at, um, you know, good, valuable, economically useful tasks. And so I, I, I would just love it if some of the former, you know, I think SB 1047 was very polarizing. I would love it if some of the most reasonable opponents and some of the most reasonable, um, uh, proponents, uh, would sit down together and, you know, I think, I think that, you know, the different, the different AI companies, um, you know, Anthropic was the, the only AI company that, you know, felt positively in a very detailed way. I think Elon tweeted, uh, tweeted briefly something positive, but you know, some of the, some of the big ones like Google, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft were, were pretty staunch, staunchly against. So I would really like is if, if, you know, some of the key stakeholders, some of the most thoughtful proponents and, and some of the most thoughtful opponents would sit down and say, how do we solve this problem in, in a way that the proponents feel brings a real reduction in risk and that the opponents feel that it is not, it is not hampering the, the industry or hampering innovation any more necessary than it, than it, than it, than it needs to. And, and I think for, for whatever reason that things got too polarized and those two groups didn't get to sit down in the way that they should. Uh, and, and I feel, I feel urgency. I really think we need to do something in 2025. Uh, uh, you know, if we get to the end of 2025 and we've still done nothing about this, then I'm going to be worried. I'm not, I'm not worried yet because again, the risks aren't here yet, but, but I, I think time is running short. Yeah. And come up with something surgical, like you said.

01:28:46 Speaker 4: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

01:28:48 Speaker 3: And we need to get, we need to get away from this, this, this intense pro safety versus intense anti -regulatory rhetoric, right? It's turned into these, these flame wars on Twitter and nothing good's going to come of that.

01:29:04 Speaker 4: So there's a lot of curiosity about the different players in the game. One of the OGs is OpenAI. You've had several years of experience at OpenAI. What's your story and history there? Yeah.

01:29:14 Speaker 3: So I was at OpenAI for, uh, for roughly five years, uh, for the last, I think it was a couple of years. You know, I, I, I, I, I was a vice president of research there. Um, probably myself and Ilya Sutskever were the ones who, you know, really kind of set the, set the research direction around 2016 or 2017, I first started to really believe in, or at least confirm my belief in the scaling hypothesis. When, when Ilya famously said to me, the thing you need to understand about these models is they just want to learn. The models just want to learn. Um, and, and, and, and again, sometimes there are these one sentence, there are these one sentences, these Zen cones that you hear them and you're like, ah, that, that explains everything. That explains like a thousand things that I've seen. And then, and then I, I, I, you know, ever after I had this visualization in my head of like, you optimize the models in the right way, you point the models in the right way. They just want to learn. They just want to solve the problem regardless of what the problem is.

01:30:08 Speaker 4: So get out of their way, basically.

01:30:10 Speaker 3: Get out of their way. Yeah. Don't impose your own ideas about how they should learn. Or, and you know, this was the same thing as Rich Sutton put out in the bitter lesson or Gurin put out in the scaling hypothesis, you know, I think generally the dynamic was, you know, I got, I got this kind of inspiration from, uh, from, from, from, from Ilya and from others, folks like Alec Radford, who did the, the original, uh, uh, GPT one, uh, and then, uh, ran really hard with it, me, me and my collaborators on GPT two, GPT three, RL from human feedback, which was an attempt to kind of deal with the early safety and durability, things like debate and amplification, heavy on interpretability. So again, the combination of safety plus scaling, probably 2018, 2019, 2020. Those, those were, those were kind of the years when. Myself and my collaborators probably, um, you know, many, many of whom became co -founders of Anthropic kind of really had, had, had a vision and like, and like drove the direction. Why'd you leave?

01:31:12 Speaker 4: Why'd you decide to leave? Yeah.

01:31:14 Speaker 3: So look, I'm going to put things this way. And I, you know, I think it, I think it ties to the, to the, to the race, to the top, right, which is, you know, in my time at open AI, what I'd come to see as I'd come to appreciate the scaling hypothesis, and as I'd come to appreciate kind of the importance of safety along with the scaling hypothesis, the first one, I think, you know, open AI was, was getting, was getting on board with. Um, the second one in a way had always been part of, of open AI's messaging. Um, but, uh, you know, over, over many years of, of the time, the time that I spent there, I think I had a particular vision of how these, how we should handle these things, how we should be brought out in the world, the kind of principles that the organization should have. And look, I mean, there were like many, many discussions about like, you know, should the org do, should the company do this? Should the company do that? Like, there's a bunch of misinformation out there. People say like, we left because we didn't like the deal with Microsoft. False. Although, you know, it was like a lot of discussion, a lot of questions about exactly how we do the deal with Microsoft. Um, we left because we didn't like commercialization. That's not true. We built GPD three, which was the model that was commercialized. I was involved in commercialization. It's, it's more again about how do you do it? Like civilization is going down this path to very powerful AI. What's the way to do it that is cautious, straightforward, honest, um, that builds trust in the organization and in individuals, how do we get from here to there and how do we have a real vision for how to get it right? How can safety not just be something we say because it helps with recruiting? Um, and you know, I think, I think at the end of the day, um, if you have a vision for that, forget about anyone else's vision. I don't want to talk about anyone else's vision. If you have a vision for how to do it, you should go off and you should do that vision. It is incredibly unproductive to try and argue with someone else's vision. You might think they're not doing it the right way. You might think they're, they're, they're dishonest. Who knows? Maybe you're right. Maybe you're not. Um, uh, but, uh, what, what you should do is you should take some people you trust and you should go off together and you should make your vision happen. And if your vision is compelling, if you can make it appeal to people, some, you know, some combination of ethically, you know, in the markets, uh, you know, if, if you can, if you can make a company, that's a place people want to join, uh, that, you know, engages in practices that people think are, are reasonable while managing to maintain its position in the ecosystem at the same time. If you do that, people will copy it. Um, and the fact that you were doing it, especially the fact that you're doing it better than they are, um, causes them to change their behavior in a much more compelling way than if they're your boss and you're arguing with them. I just, I don't know how to be any more specific about it than that, but I think it's generally very unproductive to try and get someone else's vision to look like your vision. Um, it's much more productive to go off and do a clean experiment and say, this is our vision, this is how, this is, this is how we're going to do things. Your choice is you can, you can ignore us, you can reject what we're doing, or you can, you can start to become more like us and imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Um, and you know, that, that, that plays out in the behavior of customers that pays out in the behavior of the public that plays out in the behavior of where people choose to work. Uh, and again, again, at the end, it's, it's not about one company winning or another company winning. If, if we are another company are engaging in some practice that, you know, people, people find genuinely appealing and I want it to be in substance, not just, not just in appearance. Um, and you know, I think, I think researchers are sophisticated and they look at substance, uh, and then other companies start copying that practice and they win because they copied that practice. That's great. That's success. That's like the race to the top. It doesn't matter who wins in the end, as long as everyone is copying everyone else's good practices. One way I think of it is like the thing we're all afraid of is the race to the bottom, right? And the race to the bottom doesn't matter who wins because we all lose. Right. Like, you know, in the most extreme world, we, we make this autonomous AI that, you know, the robots enslave us or whatever. Right. I mean, that's half joking, but you know, that, that is the most extreme, uh, thing, thing that could happen. Then, then it doesn't matter which company was ahead. Um, if instead you create a race to the top where people are competing to engage in good, in good practices, uh, then, uh, you know, at the end of the day, you know, it doesn't matter who ends up, who ends up winning. It doesn't even matter who, who started the race to the top. The point isn't to be virtuous. The point is to get the system into a better equilibrium than it was before. And, and individual companies can play some role in doing this. Individual companies can, can, you know, can help to start it, can help to accelerate it. And frankly, I think individuals and other companies have, have done this as well. Right. The individuals that when we put out an RSP react by pushing harder to, to, to get something similar done, get something similar done at, at, at other companies. Sometimes other companies do something that's like, we're like, oh, it's a good practice. We think, we think that's good. We should adopt it too. The only difference is, you know, I think, I think we are, um, we try to be more forward leaning. We try and adopt more of these practices first and adopt them more quickly when others, when others invent them. But I think this dynamic is what we should be pointing at. And that, I think, I think it abstracts away the question of, you know, which company's winning, who trusts, who I think all these, all these questions of drama are, are profoundly uninteresting. And, and the, the thing that matters is the ecosystem that we all operate in and how to make that ecosystem better, because that constrains all the players.

01:37:06 Speaker 4: And so Anthropic is this kind of clean experiment built on a foundation of like, what. Concretely AISAT should look like.

01:37:13 Speaker 3: We're look, I'm sure we've made plenty of mistakes along the way. The perfect organization doesn't exist. It has to deal with the, the imperfection of a thousand employees. It has to deal with the imperfection of our leaders, including me. It has to deal with the imperfection of the people we've put, we've put to, you know, to oversee the imperfection of the, of the leaders, like the, like the board and the long -term benefit trust. It's, it's all, it's all a set of imperfect people trying to aim imperfectly at some ideal that will never perfectly be achieved. Um, that's what you sign up for. That's what it will always be. But, uh, uh, imperfect doesn't mean you just give up there's better and there's worse. And hopefully, hopefully we can begin to build. We can do well enough that we can begin to build some practices that the whole industry engages in. And then, you know, my guess is that multiple of these companies will be successful and drop it, will be successful. These other companies, like once I've been at the past will also be successful and some will be more successful than others that's less important than again, that we, we align the incentives of the industry. And that happens partly through the race to the top, partly through things like RSP, partly through again, selected surgical regulation.

01:38:25 Speaker 4: You said talent density beats talent mass. So can you explain that? Can you expand on that? Can you just talk about what it takes to build a great team of AI researchers and engineers?

01:38:37 Speaker 3: This is one of these statements. That's like more true every, every, every month, every month. I see this statement is more true than I did the month before. So if I were to do a thought experiment, let's say you have a team of 100 people that are super smart, motivated, and aligned with the mission, and that's your company. Or you can have a team of a thousand people where 200 people are super smart, super aligned with the mission. And then, uh, like a, and then like 800 people are, let's just say you pick 800, like random, random, big tech employees, which would you rather have? Right. The talent mass is greater in the, in the group of, uh, in the group of a thousand people, right? You have, you have even, even a larger number of incredibly talented, incredibly aligned, incredibly smart people. Um, uh, but, but the, the issue is just that if every, every time someone super talented looks around, they see someone else super talented and super dedicated that sets the tone for everything, right? That sets the tone for everyone is super inspired to work at the same place. Everyone trusts everyone else. If you have a thousand or 10 ,000 people and, and things have really regressed, right, you are not able to do selection and you're choosing random people. What happens is then you need to put a lot of processes and a lot of guardrails in place, um, just because people don't fully trust each other. You have to adjudicate political battles. Like there are so many things that slow down the org's ability to operate. And so we're nearly a thousand people and you know, we've, we've, we've tried to make it so that as large a fraction of those thousand people as possible are like super talented, super skilled. It's one of the reasons we've, we've slowed down hiring a lot in the last few months. We grew from 300 to 800, I believe. I think in the first seven, eight months of the year, and now we've slowed down. We're at like, you know, last three months we went from 800 to 900, nine 50, something like that. Don't quote me on the exact numbers. But I think there's an inflection point around a thousand and we want to be much more careful how, how we, how we grow, uh, early on and, and now as well, you know, we've hired a lot of physicists. Um, you know, theoretical physicists can learn things really fast. Um, uh, even, even more recently as we've continued to hire that, you know, we've really had a high bar for, on both the research side and the software engineering side have hired a lot of senior people, including folks who used to be at other, at other companies in this space. And we we've just continued to be very selective. It's very easy to go from a hundred to a thousand and a thousand to 10 ,000 without paying attention to making sure everyone has a unified purpose. It's so powerful. If your company consists of a lot of different fiefdoms that all want to do their own thing, they're all optimizing for their own thing. Um, uh, it's very hard to get anything done, but if everyone sees the broader purpose of the company, if there's trust and there's dedication to doing the right thing, that is a superpower that in itself, I think can overcome almost every other disadvantage.

01:41:42 Speaker 4: And, you know, it's the Steve jobs, a players, a players want to look around and see other a players as another way of saying, I don't know what that is about human nature, but it is demotivating to see people who are not obsessively driving towards a singular mission. And it is on the flip side of that super motivating to see that. It's interesting. Uh, what's it take to be a great AI researcher or engineer from everything you've seen from working with so many amazing people?

01:42:09 Speaker 3: Yeah. Um, I think the number one quality, especially on the research side, but really both is open -mindedness sounds easy to be open -minded, right? You're just like, oh, I'm open to anything. Um, but you know, if I, if I think about my own early history in the scaling hypothesis, um, I was seeing the same data others were seeing. I don't think I was like a better programmer or better at coming up with research ideas than any of the hundreds of people that I worked with. Um, in some ways, in some ways I was worse. Um, uh, you know, like I've, I've never like, you know, precise programming of like, you know, finding the bug, writing the GPU kernels. Like I could point you to a hundred people here who are better, who are better at that than I am. Um, but, but the, the thing that, that, that I think I did have that was different was that I was just willing to look at something with new eyes. Right. People said, oh, you know, we don't have the right algorithms yet. We haven't come up with the right. The right way to do things. And I was just like, oh, I don't know. Like, you know, this neural net has like 30 billion, 30 million parameters. Like what if we gave it 50 million instead, like let's plot some graphs like that, that basic scientific mindset of like, oh man, like I, I just, I just like, I, you know, I see some variable that I could change, like what happens when it changes, like, let's, let's try these different things and like create a graph for even the, this was like the simplest thing in the world, right. Change the number of, you know, this wasn't like PhD level experimental design. This was like, this was like simple and stupid. Like anyone could have done this if you, if you just told them that, that, that it was important. It's also not hard to understand. You didn't need to be brilliant to come up with this. But you put the two things together and, you know, some tiny number of people, some single digit number of people have, have driven forward the whole field by realizing this. And, and it's, you know, it's often like that. If you look back at the discovery, you know, the discoveries in history, they're, they're often like that. And so this, this open -mindedness and this willingness to see with new eyes that often comes from being newer to the field, often experience is a disadvantage for this, that is the most important thing. It's very hard to look for and test for, but I think, I think it's the most important thing because when you, when you find something, some really new way of thinking, thinking about things, when you have the initiative to do that, it's absolutely transformative.

01:44:34 Speaker 4: And also be able to do kind of rapid experimentation and in the face of that, be open -minded and curious and looking at the data for just these fresh eyes and seeing what is that it's actually saying that applies in mechanistic interpretability.

01:44:46 Speaker 3: It's another example of this, like some of the early work in mechanistic interpretability, so simple. It's just, no one thought to care about this question before.

01:44:56 Speaker 4: You said what it takes to be a great AI researcher. Can we rewind the clock back? What, what advice would you give to people interested in AI? They're young, looking forward to how can I make an impact on the world?

01:45:06 Speaker 3: I think my number one piece of advice is to just start playing with the models. Um, this was actually, I, I worry a little, this seems like obvious advice. Now, I think three years ago, it wasn't obvious and people started by, Oh, let me read the latest reinforcement learning paper. Let me, you know, let me, let me kind of, um, no, I mean, that was really the, that was really the, the, the, I mean, you should do that as well, but, uh, now, you know, with wider availability of models and APIs, people are doing this more, but I think, I think just experiential knowledge, um, these models are new artifacts that no one really understands. Um, and so getting experience playing with them. I would also say again, in line with the, like, do something new, think in some new direction. Like there are all these things that haven't been explored. Like for example, mechanistic interpretability is still very new. It's probably better to work on that than it is to work on new model architectures because it's, you know, it's more popular than it was before. There are probably like a hundred people working on it, but there aren't like 10 ,000 people working on it. And it's, it's just this, this fertile area for study. Like, like, you know, it's, there's, there's so much like low hanging fruit. You can just walk by and, you know, you can just walk by and you can pick things. Um, and, and the, the only reason for whatever reason people aren't, people aren't interested in it enough. I think there are some things around long, long horizon learning and long horizon tasks where there's a lot to be done, I think evaluations are still, we're still very early in our ability to study evaluations, particularly for dynamic systems, acting in the world. I think there's some stuff around multi -agent, um, skate where the puck is going is my, is my advice. And you don't have to be brilliant to think of it. Like all the things that are going to be exciting in five years, like in, in people even mentioned them as like, you know, conventional wisdom, but like, it's, it's just somehow there's this barrier that people don't, people don't double down as much as they could, or they're afraid to do something that's not the popular thing. I don't know why it happens, but like getting over that barrier is the, that's the, my number one piece of advice.

01:47:14 Speaker 4: Let's talk if it could a bit about post -training. Yeah. So it, uh, seems that the modern post -training recipe has, uh, a little bit of everything. So supervised fine tuning, RLHF, uh, the, the, the constitutional AI with RLAIF. Best acronym. It's again, that naming thing. Uh, and then synthetic data seems like a lot of synthetic data, or at least trying to figure out ways to have high quality synthetic data. So what's the, uh, if this is a secret sauce that makes anthropic clods so, uh, incredible. What, how, how much of the magic is in the pre -training? How much of it is in the post -training? Yeah.

01:47:54 Speaker 3: Um, I mean, so first of all, we're not perfectly able to measure that ourselves. Um, uh, you know, when you see some, some great character ability, sometimes it's hard to tell whether it came from pre -training or post -training. Uh, we've developed ways to try and distinguish between those two, but they're not perfect. You know, the second thing I would say is, you know, it's when there is an advantage and I think we've been pretty good at, in general, in general at RL, perhaps, perhaps the best, although, although I don't know, cause I don't see what goes on inside other companies. Uh, usually it isn't, oh my God, we have this secret magic method that others don't have, right? Usually it's like, well, you know, we got better at the infrastructure, so we could run it for longer, or, you know, we were able to get higher quality data, or we were able to filter our data better, or we were able to, you know, combine these methods in practice. It's, it's usually some boring matter of matter of kind of, uh, uh, uh, uh, practice and trade craft. Um, so, you know, when I think about how to do something special in terms of how we train these models, both pre -training, but even more so post training, um, you know, I, I really think of it a little more again, as like designing airplanes or cars. Like, you know, it's not just like, oh man, I have the blueprint. Like maybe that makes you make the next airplane, but like, there's some, there's some cultural trade craft of how we think about the design process that I think is more important than, than, you know, than, than any particular gizmo we're able to invent. Okay.

01:49:18 Speaker 4: Well, about, let me ask you about specific techniques. So first on RLHF, what do you think, just zooming out intuition, almost philosophy, why do you think RLHF works so well?

01:49:28 Speaker 3: If I go back to like the scaling hypothesis, one of the ways to skate the scaling hypothesis is if you train for X and you throw enough compute at it, um, then you get X. And, and so RLHF is good at doing what humans want the model to do, or at least, um, to state it more precisely doing what humans who look at the model for a brief period of time and consider different possible responses, what they prefer as the response, uh, which is not perfect from both the safety and capabilities perspective in that humans are often not able to perfectly identify what the model wants and what humans want in the moment may not be what they want in the longterm. So there's, there's a lot of subtlety there, but the models are good at, uh, you know, producing what the humans in some shallow sense want. Uh, and it actually turns out that you don't even have to throw that much compute at it because of another thing, which is this, this thing about a strong pre -trained model being halfway to anywhere. Uh, uh, uh, so once you have the pre -trained model, you have all the representations you need to, to get the model, uh, to get the model where you, where you want it to go.

01:50:34 Speaker 4: So do you think our RLHF makes the model smarter or just appear smarter to the humans?

01:50:41 Speaker 3: I don't think it makes the model smarter. I don't think it just makes the model appear smarter. It's like RLHF like bridges the gap between the human and the model, right? I could have something really smart that like can't communicate at all. Right. We all know people like this, um, people who are really smart, but the, the, you know, you can't understand what they're saying. Um, uh, so I think, I think RLHF just bridges that gap. Um, I think it's not, it's not the only kind of RL we do. It's not the only kind of RL that will happen in the future. I think RL has the potential to make models smarter, to make them reason better, to make them operate better, to make them develop new skills even. And perhaps that could be done, you know, even in some cases with human feedback, but the kind of RLHF we do today mostly doesn't do that yet. Although we're very quickly starting to be able to, but it appears to sort of

01:51:32 Speaker 4: increase, if you look at the metric of helpfulness, it increases that it also

01:51:37 Speaker 3: increases, what was this, this word in Leopold's essay unhobbling, where basically the models are hobbled and then you do various trainings to them, to unhobble them. So I, you know, I like that word cause it's like a rare word, but it's so, so I think RLHF unhobbles the models in some ways. And then there are other ways where a model hasn't yet been unhobbled and, and, you know, needs to, needs to unhobble.

01:51:58 Speaker 4: If you can say in terms of costs, is pre -training the most expensive thing or is post -training creep up to that?

01:52:05 Speaker 3: At the present moment, it is still the case that pre -training is the majority of the cost. I don't know what to expect in the future, but I could certainly anticipate a future where post -training is the majority of the cost.

01:52:16 Speaker 4: In that future you anticipate, would it be the humans or the AI that's the costly thing for the post -training?

01:52:22 Speaker 3: I, I, I don't think you can scale up humans enough to get high quality. Any, any kind of method that relies on humans and uses a large amount of compute, it's going to have to rely on some scaled supervision method. Like, uh, uh, like, um, you know, debate or iterated amplification or something like that.

01:52:39 Speaker 4: So on that super interesting, um, set of ideas around constitutional AI, can you describe what it is as first detailed in December 2022 paper? And, uh, and beyond that, what is it? Yes.

01:52:53 Speaker 3: So this was from two years ago. The basic idea is, so we describe what RLHF is. You have, uh, you have a model and, uh, it, you know, spits out two pot, you know, like you just sample from it twice. It spits out two possible responses and you're like human, which response do you like better? Or another variant of it is rate this response on a scale of one to seven. So that's hard because you need to scale up human interaction and, uh, it's very implicit, right? I don't have a sense of what I want the model to do. I just have a sense of like what this average of a thousand humans wants the model to do. So two ideas, one is could the AI system itself decide which, uh, which response is better, right? Could you show the AI system, these two responses and ask which, which, which response is better. And then second, well, what criterion should the AI use? And so then there's this idea, cause you have a single document, a constitution, if you will, that says, these are the principles the model should be using to respond. And the AI system reads those. Um, it, it reads those principles as well as reading the environment and the response. And it says, well, how good did the AI model do? Um, it's basically a form of self play. You're kind of training the model against itself. And so the AI gives the response and then you feed that back into what's called the preference model, which in turn feeds the model to make it better. Um, so you have this triangle of like the AI, the preference model and the improvement of the AI itself.

01:54:22 Speaker 4: And we should say that in the constitution, the set of principles are like human interpretable. They're like, yeah, yeah.

01:54:28 Speaker 3: It's, it's something both the human and the AI system can read. So it has this nice, this nice kind of translatability or symmetry. Um, you know, in, in practice, we both use a model constitution and we use RLHF and we use some of these other methods, so it's, it's turned into one tool in a, in a toolkit that both reduces the need for RLHF and increases the value we get from, um, from, from using each data point of RLHF. Um, it also interacts in interesting ways with kind of future reasoning type RL methods. So, um, it's, it's one tool in the toolkit, but, but I think it is a very important tool.

01:55:05 Speaker 4: Well, it's a compelling one to us humans, you know, thinking about the founding fathers and the founding of the United States, the natural question is who and how do you think it gets to define the constitution, the, the set of principles in the constitution? Yeah.

01:55:20 Speaker 3: So I'll give like a practical answer and a more abstract answer. I think the practical answer is like, look in practice, models get used by all kinds of different like customers. Right. And, and so, uh, you can have this idea where, you know, the model can, can have specialized rules or principles. You know, we fine tune versions of models implicitly. We've talked about doing it explicitly, having, having special principles that people can build into the models. Um, uh, so from a practical perspective, the answer can be very different from different people. Uh, you know, customer service agent, uh, you know, behaves very differently from a lawyer and obeys different principles. Um, but I think at the base of it, there are specific principles that the models, uh, you know, have to obey. I think a lot of them are things that people would agree with. Everyone agrees that, you know, we don't, you know, we don't want models to present these CBRN risks. Um, I think we can go a little further and agree with some basic principles of democracy and the rule of law. Beyond that, it gets, you know, very uncertain and, and there, our goal is generally for the models to be more neutral, to not espouse a particular point of view and, you know, more just be kind of like wise, uh, agents or advisors that will help you think things through and will, you know, present, present possible considerations, but, you know, don't express, you know, strong or specific opinions.

01:56:42 Speaker 4: OpenAI released a model spec where it kind of clearly concretely defines some of the goals of the model and specific examples like A, B, how the model should behave. Do you find that interesting? By the way, I should mention the, I believe the brilliant John Shulman was a part of that. He's now at Anthropic. Uh, do you think this is a useful direction? Might Anthropic release a model spec as well? Yeah.

01:57:06 Speaker 3: So I think that's a pretty useful direction. Again, it has a lot in common with a constitutional AI. So again, another example of like a race to the top, right? We have something that's like, we think, you know, a better and more responsible way of doing things. Um, it's also a competitive advantage. Um, then, uh, others kind of, you know, discover that it has advantages and then start to do that thing. Uh, we then no longer have the competitive advantage, but it's good from the perspective that now everyone has adopted a positive practice that others were not adopting. And so our response to that as well, looks like we need a new competitive advantage in order to keep driving this race upwards. Um, so that's, that's how I generally feel about that. I also think every implementation of these things is different. So, you know, there were some things in the model spec that were not in constitutional AI. And so, you know, we, you know, we can always, we can always adopt those things or, you know, at least learn from them. Um, so again, I think this is an example of like the positive dynamic that, uh, that, that, that I, that, that I think we should all want the field to have.

01:58:06 Speaker 4: Let's talk about the incredible essay machines of love and grace. I recommend everybody read it. It's a long one.

01:58:12 Speaker 3: It is rather long. Yeah.

01:58:14 Speaker 4: It's really refreshing to read concrete ideas about what a positive future looks like. And you took sort of a bold stance because like, it's very possible that you might be wrong on the dates or specific applications.

01:58:25 Speaker 3: I'm fully expecting to, you know, to de will definitely be wrong about all the details. I might be, be just spectacularly wrong about the whole thing. And people will, you know, will laugh at me for years. Um, uh, that's, that's how that's, that's just how the future works.

01:58:40 Speaker 4: So you provided a bunch of concrete, positive impacts of AI and how. You know, exactly a super intelligent AI might accelerate the rate of breakthroughs in, for example, biology and chemistry that would then lead to things like we cure most cancers, prevent all infectious disease, double the human lifespan and so on. So let's talk about this essay first. Can you give a high level vision of this essay and, um, what key takeaways that people have?

01:59:09 Speaker 3: Yeah, I have spent a lot of time in Anthropic. I spent a lot of effort on like, you know, how do we address the risks of AI? Right. How do we think about those risks? Like we're trying to do a race to the top, you know, what that requires us to build all these capabilities and the capabilities are cool, but, you know, you know, we're, we're, we're like a big part of what we're trying to do is like, is like address the risks. And the justification for that is like, well, you know, all these positive things, you know, the market is this very healthy organism, right? It's going to produce all the positive things, the risks. I don't know. We might mitigate them. We might not. And so we can have more impact by trying to mitigate the risks. But I noticed that one flaw in that way of thinking, and it's, it's not a change in how seriously I take the risks. It's, it's maybe a change in how I talk about them. Um, is that, you know, no matter how kind of logical or rational that line of reasoning that I just gave might be, um, if, if you kind of only talk about risks, your brain only thinks about risks. And, and so I think it's actually very important to understand what if things do go well? And the whole reason we're trying to prevent these risks is not because we're afraid of technology, not because we want to slow it down. It's, it's, it's because if we can get to the other side of these risks, right. If we can run the gauntlet successfully, um, to, you know, to, to put it in stark terms, then, then on the other side of the gauntlet are all these great things and these things are worth fighting for and these things can really inspire people. And I think I imagine because look, you have all these investors, all these VCs, all these AI companies talking about all the positive benefits of AI. But as you point out, it's, it's, it's weird. There's actually a dearth of really getting specific about it. There's a lot of like random people on Twitter, like posting these kind of like gleaming cities and this, this just kind of like vibe of like grind, accelerate harder, like kick out the D cell. You know, it's, it's just this very, this very like aggressive ideological, but then you're like, well, what are you, what, what, what, what, what, what are you actually excited about? And so, and so I figured that, you know, I think it would be interesting and valuable for someone who's actually coming from the risk side to, to try and, and to try and really make a try at, at explaining, explaining, explain what the benefits are both because I think it's something we can all get behind and I want people to understand, I want them to really understand that this isn't, this this is that if you have a true understanding of where things are going with, with AI and maybe that's the more important axis, AI is moving fast versus AI is not moving fast, then you really appreciate the benefits and you, you, you really, you want humanity, our civilization to seize those benefits, but you also get very serious about anything that could derail them.

02:02:09 Speaker 4: So I think the starting point is to talk about what this powerful AI, which is the term you like to use, uh, most of the world uses AGI, but you don't like the term because it's, uh, basically has too much baggage. It's become meaningless. It's like, we're stuck with the terms.

02:02:25 Speaker 3: I mean, maybe we're stuck with the terms and my efforts to change them are futile. It's admirable. I'll tell you what else I don't, this is like a pointless semantic point, but I, yeah, I, I keep talking about it in public, so I'm just going to do it once more. Um, uh, I, I think it's, it's a little like, like, let's say it was like 1995 and Moore's law is making the computers faster. And like, for some reason there, there, there, there had been this like verbal tick that like, everyone was like, well, someday we're going to have like supercomputers and like supercomputers are going to be able to do all these things that like, you know, once we have supercomputers, we'll be able to like sequence the genome, we'll be able to do other things. And so, and so like one, it's true. The computers are getting faster and as they get faster, they're going to be able to do all these great things. But there's like, there's no discrete point at which you had a supercomputer and previous computers were not to like supercomputers, a term we use, but like, it's a vague term to just describe like computers that are faster than what we have today. Um, there's no point at which you pass the threshold and you're like, Oh my God, we're doing a totally new type of computation and new. And so I feel that way about AGI. Like there's just a smooth exponential. And like, if, if by AGI, you mean like, like AI is getting better and better and like gradually it's going to do more and more of what humans do until it's going to be smarter than humans. And then it's going to get smarter even from there, then, then yes, I believe in AGI if, but if, if, if AGI is some discrete or separate thing, which is the way people often talk about it, then it's, it's kind of a meaningless buzzword. Yeah.

02:03:49 Speaker 4: I mean, to me, it's just sort of a platonic form of a powerful AI, exactly how you define it, I mean, you define it very nicely. So on the intelligence axis, it's just on pure intelligence. It's smarter than a Nobel prize winner, as you describe across most relevant disciplines. So, okay. That's just intelligence. So it's both in creativity and be able to generate new ideas, all that kind of stuff in every discipline, Nobel prize winner. Okay. In their prime, it can use every modality. So this kind of self -explanatory, but just to operate across all the modalities of the world it can go off for many hours, days and weeks to do tasks and do its own sort of detailed planning and only ask you help when it's needed. Uh, it can use, this is actually kind of interesting. Cause I think in the essay you said, I mean, again, it's a bet that it's not going to be embodied, but it can control embodied tools. So it can control tools, robots, laboratory equipment, the resource used to train it can then be repurposed to run millions of copies of it. And each of those copies would be independent that can do their own independent work. So you can do the cloning of the intelligence. Yeah. Yeah.

02:05:03 Speaker 3: I mean, you, you might imagine from outside the field that like, there's only one of these, right? That like you made it, you've only made one, but the truth is that like the scale up is very quick. Like we, we do this today. We make a model and then we deploy thousands, maybe tens of thousands of instances of it. I think by the time, you know, certainly within two to three years, whether we have these super powerful AIs or not, clusters are going to get to the size where you'll be able to deploy millions of these and they'll be faster than humans. And so if your picture is, oh, we'll have one and then it'll take a while to make them my point. There was no, actually you have millions of them right away.

02:05:38 Speaker 4: And in general, they can learn and act. Uh, 10 to a hundred times faster than humans. So that's a really nice definition of powerful AI. Okay. So that, but you also write that clearly such an entity would be capable of solving very difficult problems very fast, but it is not trivial to figure out how fast two extreme positions both seem false to me. So the singularity is on the one extreme and the opposite and the other extreme. Can you describe each of the extremes? Yeah.

02:06:06 Speaker 3: So, so yeah, let's, let's describe the extreme. So like one, one extreme would be, well, look, um, you know, uh, if we look at kind of evolutionary history, like there was this big acceleration where, you know, for hundreds of thousands of years, we just had like, you know, single celled organisms and then we had mammals and then we had apes and then that quickly turned to humans, humans quickly built industrial civilization. And so this is going to keep speeding up and there's no ceiling at the human level. Once models get much, much smarter than humans, they'll get really good at building the next models. And, you know, if you write down like a simple differential equation, like this is an exponential. And so what's, what's going to happen is that, uh, models will build faster models, models will build faster models. And those models will build, you know, nanobots that can like take over the world and produce much more energy than you could produce otherwise. And so if you just kind of like solve this abstract differential equation, then like five days after we, you know, we build the first AI that's more powerful than humans, then, then, uh, you know, like the world will be filled with these AIs and every possible technology that could be invented, like will be invented. Um, I'm caricaturing this a little bit. Um, uh, but I, you know, I think that's one extreme. And the reason that I think that's not the case is that one, I think they just neglect like the laws of physics. Like it's only possible to do things so fast in the physical world. Like some of those loops go through, you know, producing faster hardware. Um, uh, it takes a long time to produce faster hardware. Things take a long time. There's this issue of complexity. Like, I think no matter how smart you are, like, you know, people talk about, oh, we can make models of biological systems. It'll do everything. The biological systems. Look, I think computational modeling can do a lot. I did a lot of computational modeling when I worked in biology, but like just. There are a lot of things that you can't predict how they're, you know, they're, they're complex enough that like just iterating, just running the experiment is going to beat any modeling, no matter how smart the system doing the modeling is.

02:08:08 Speaker 4: Or even if it's not interacting with the physical world, just the modeling is going to be hard. Yeah.

02:08:12 Speaker 3: I think the modeling is going to be hard and getting the model to, to, to, to match the physical world is going to be all right. So he does have to enter.

02:08:20 : Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

02:08:21 Speaker 3: Verify, but, but it's just, you know, you just look at even the simplest problems. Like I, you know, I think I talk about like, you know, the three body problem or simple chaotic prediction, like, you know, or, or like predicting the economy. It's really hard to predict the economy two years out. Like maybe the case is like, you know, normal, you know, humans can predict what's going to happen in the economy next quarter, although they can't really do that, maybe eight, maybe a AI system that's, you know, a zillion times smarter can only predict it out a year or something instead of, instead of, you know, you have these kind of exponential increase in computer intelligence for linear increase in, in, in ability to predict same with, again, like, you know, biological molecules, molecules interacting, you don't know what's going to happen when you perturb a, when you perturb a complex system. You can find simple parts in it. If you're smarter, you're better at finding these simple parts. And then I think human institutions, human institutions are just, are really difficult, like it's, you know, it's, it's been hard to get people. I won't give specific examples, but it's been hard to get people to adopt even the technologies that we've developed, even ones where the case for their efficacy is very, very strong. Um, you know, people have concerns. They think things are conspiracy theories. Like it's, it's just been, it's been very difficult. It's also been very difficult to get, you know, very simple things through the regulatory system. Right. I think, you know, and you know, I, I don't want to disparage anyone who, you know, you know, works in regulatory, regulatory systems of any technology. There are hard trade -offs they have to deal with. They have to save lives, but, but the system as a whole, I think makes some obvious trade -offs that are very far from maximizing human welfare. And so if we bring AI systems into this, you know, into these human systems, often the level of intelligence may just not be the limiting factor, right? It, it, it just may be that it takes a long time to do something. Now, if the AI system, uh, circumvented all governments, if it just said I'm dictator of the world and I'm going to do whatever, some of these things that could do again, the things having to do with complexity, I still think a lot of things would take a while. I don't think it helps that the AI systems can produce a lot of energy or go to the moon. Like some people in comments responded to the essay saying the AI system can produce a lot of energy and smarter AI systems that's missing the point. That kind of cycle doesn't solve the key problems that I'm talking about here. Um, so I think, I think a bunch of people miss the point there, but even if it were completely unaligned and, you know, could get around all these human obstacles, it would have trouble. But again, if you want this to be an AI system that doesn't take over the world, that doesn't destroy humanity, then, then basically, you know, it's, it's, it's going to need to follow basic human laws, right? Well, you know, if we want to have an actually good world, like we're going to have to have an AI system that, that interacts with humans, not one that kind of creates its own legal system or disregards all the laws or all of that. So as inefficient as these processes are, you know, we're going to have to deal with them because there, there needs to be some popular and democratic legitimacy in how these systems are rolled out. We can't have a small group of people who are developing these systems say, this is what's best for everyone. Right. I think it's wrong. And I think in practice it's not going to work anyway. So you put all those things together and, you know, we're not, we're not going to, we're not going to, you know, change the world and upload everyone in five minutes. Uh, it's, I, I, I just, I don't think I, A, I don't think it's going to happen. And B to some, you know, to the extent that it could happen, it's, it's not the way to lead to a good world. So that's on one side. On the other side, there's another set of perspectives, which I have actually in some ways, more sympathy for, which is look, we've seen big productivity increases before, right? You know, economists are familiar with studying the productivity increases that came from the computer revolution and internet revolution. And generally those productivity increases were underwhelming. They were less than you, than you might imagine. Um, there was a quote from Robert Solow, you see the computer revolution everywhere, except the productivity statistics. So why is this the case? People point to the structure of firms, the structure of enterprises, how, um, uh, you know, how slow it's been to roll out our existing technology to very poor parts of the world, which I talk about in the essay, right? How do we get these technologies to the poorest parts of the world that are behind on cell phone technology, computers, medicine, let alone, you know, newfangled AI that hasn't been invented yet. Um, so you could have a perspective. It's like, well, this is amazing technically, but it's all a nothing burger. Um, uh, you know, I think, um, Tyler Cowen who, who wrote something in response to my essay has that perspective. I think he thinks the radical change will happen eventually, but he thinks it'll take 50 or a hundred years. And, and you could have even more static perspectives on the whole thing. I think there's some truth to it. I think the timescale is just, is just too long. Um, and, and I can see it. I can actually see both sides with today's AI. So, uh, you know, a lot of our customers are large enterprises who are used to doing things a certain way. Um, I've also seen it in talking to governments, right? Those are, those are prototypical, you know, institutions, entities that are slow to change. Uh, but the dynamic I see over and over again is yes, it takes a long time to move the ship. Yes. There's a lot of resistance and lack of understanding, but the thing that makes me feel that progress will in the end happen moderately fast, not incredibly fast, but moderately fast is that you talk to what I find is I find over and over again, again, in large companies, even in governments, um, which have been actually surprisingly forward leaning, uh, you find two things that move things forward. One, you find a small fraction of people within a company, within a government who really see the big picture, who see the whole scaling hypothesis, who understand where AI is going, or at least understand where it's going within their industry. And there are a few people like that within the current, within the current U S government who really see the whole picture. And, and those people see that this is the most important thing in the world until they agitate for it. And the thing that they alone are not enough to succeed because they're a small set of people within a large organization, but as the technology starts to roll out, as it succeeds in some places in the folks who are most willing to adopt it, the specter of competition gives them a wind at their backs because they can point within their large organization. They can say, look, these other guys are doing this, right? You know, one bank can say, look, this new fangled hedge fund is doing this thing. They're going to eat our lunch in the U S we can say, we're afraid China is going to get there before, before we are. Uh, and that combination, the specter of competition, plus a few visionaries within these, you know, within these, the organizations that in many ways are sclerotic, you put those two things together and it actually makes something happen. I mean, it's interesting. It's a balanced fight between the two because inertia is very powerful, but, but, but eventually over enough time, the innovative approach breaks through. Um, and I've seen that happen. I've seen the arc of that over and over again. And it's like the, the barriers are there, the, the barriers to progress, the complexity, not knowing how to use the model, how to deploy them are there. And, and for a bit, it seems like they're going to last forever. Like change doesn't happen, but then eventually change happens and always comes from a few people. I felt the same way when I was an advocate of the scaling hypothesis within the AI field itself and others didn't get it, it felt like no one would ever get it. It felt like, then it felt like we had a secret, almost no one ever had. And then a couple of years later, everyone has the secret. And so I think that's how it's going to go with deployment to AI in the world. It's going to, the, the barriers are going to fall apart gradually and then all at once. And so I think this is going to be more, and this is just an instinct. I could, I could easily see how I'm wrong. I think it's going to be more like 10, five or 10 years. As I say in the essay, then it's going to be 50 or a hundred years. I also think it's going to be five or 10 years more than it's going to be, you know, five or 10 hours, uh, because I've just, I've just seen how human systems work. And I think a lot of these people who write down the differential equations, who say AI is going to make more powerful AI, who can't understand how it could possibly be the case that these things won't, won't change so fast. I think they don't understand these things.

02:17:11 Speaker 4: So what do you use the timeline to where we achieve AGI, AKA powerful AI, AKA super useful AI. Start calling it that. It's a debate. It's a debate about naming, um, you know, on pure intelligence, it can smarter than a Nobel prize winner in every relevant discipline and all the things we've said, modality can go and do stuff on its own for days, weeks, and do biology experiments, uh, on its own in one, you know what, let's just stick to biology because you sold me on the whole biology and health section. And that's so exciting from, um, from just, I was getting giddy from a scientific perspective. It made me want to be a biologist.

02:17:56 Speaker 3: It's almost, it's so, no, no, this was the feeling I had when I was writing it, that it's, it's like, this would be such a beautiful future if we can, if we can just, if we can just make it happen, right. If we can just get the, get the landmines out of the way and, and, and make it happen, there's, there's so much, there's so much beauty and, and, and, and, and elegance and moral force behind it. If, if we can, if we can just, and it's something we should all be able to agree on, right? Like as much as we fight about, about all these political questions, is, is this something that could actually bring us together? Um, but you were asking when, when, when, when, when do you think what's just so so, you know, this, this is of course the thing I've been grappling with for many years and I'm not, I'm not at all confident every time, if I say 2026 or 2027, there'll be like a zillion, like people on Twitter who will be like, Hey, I see, yo said 2026, 2020, and it'll be repeated for like the next two years that like, this is definitely when I think it's going to happen. Um, so whoever's exerting these clips, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll crop out the thing I just said and, and only say the thing I'm about to say. Um, but I'll just say it anyway. Um, uh, so, uh, if you extrapolate the curves that we've had so far, right. If, if you say, well, I don't know, we're starting to get to like PhD level. And, and last year we were at, um, uh, undergraduate level and the year before we were at like the level of a high school student, again, you can, you can quibble with at what tasks and for what we're still missing modalities, but those are being added, like computer use was added, like image in was added, like image generation has been added. If you just kind of like, and this is totally unscientific, but if you just kind of like eyeball the rate at which these capabilities are increasing, it does make you think that we'll get there by 2026 or 2027, again, lots of things could derail it. We could run out of data. You know, we might not be able to scale clusters as much as we want. Like, you know, maybe Taiwan gets blown up or something and, you know, then we can't produce as many GPUs as we want. So there are, there are all kinds of things that could, could derail the whole process. So I don't fully believe the straight line extrapolation, but if you believe the straight line extrapolation, you'll, you'll, we'll get there in 2026 or 2027. I think the most likely is that there's some mild delay relative to that. Um, I don't know what that delay is, but I think it could happen on schedule. I think there could be a mild delay. I think there are still worlds where it doesn't happen in, in a hundred years. Those were the number of those worlds is rapidly decreasing. We are rapidly running out of truly convincing brocklers, truly compelling reasons why this will not happen in the next few years, there were a lot more in 2020, um, although my, my guess, my hunch at that time was that we'll make it through all those blockers. So sitting as someone who has seen most of the blockers cleared out of the way, I kind of suspect my hunch, my suspicion is that the rest of them will not block us. Uh, but. Uh, you know, look, look, look at the end of the day, like, I don't want to represent this as a scientific prediction. People call them scaling laws. That's a misnomer. Like Moore's law is, is, is a misnomer. Moore's law scaling laws. They're not laws of the universe. They're empirical regularities. I am going to bet in favor of them continuing, but I'm not certain of that.

02:21:15 Speaker 4: So you extensively described sort of the compressed 21st century, how AGI will help, uh, set forth a chain of breakthroughs in biology and medicine that help us in all these kinds of ways that I mentioned. So how do you think, what are the early steps it might do? And by the way, I asked Claude good questions to ask you and Claude told me. Uh, to ask, what do you think is a typical day for a biologist working on AGI look like under, in this future?

02:21:46 Speaker 3: Yeah. Yeah. Claude is curious. Let me, well, let me start with your first questions and then I'll, then I'll answer that. Claude, Claude wants to know what's in his future, right?

02:21:53 : Exactly.

02:21:54 Speaker 3: Who am I going to be working with? Exactly. Um, so I think one of the things I went hard on when I went hard on in the essay is, let me go back to this idea of, because it's, it's really had an, you know, had an impact on me, this idea that within large organizations and systems, there end up being a few people or a few new ideas who kind of cause things to go in a different direction. They would have before who, who kind of, uh, disproportionately affect the trajectory. There's a bunch of kind of the same thing going on, right? If you think about the health world, there's like, you know, trillions of dollars to pay out Medicare and, you know, other health insurance. And then the NIH is a hundred billion. And then if I think of like the few things that have really revolutionized anything, it could be encapsulated in a small, small fraction of that. And so when I think of like, where will AI have an impact? I'm like, can AI turn that small fraction into a much larger fraction and raise its quality? And within biology, my experience within biology is that the biggest problem of biology is that you can't see what's going on. You, you have very little ability to see what's going on and even less ability to change it, right? What you have is this, like, like from this, you have to infer that there's a bunch of cells that within each cell is, you know, uh, uh, 3 billion base pairs of DNA built according to a genetic code, uh, uh, and, you know, there are all these processes that are just going on without any ability of us as, uh, you know, unaugmented humans to affect it. These cells are dividing most of the time that's healthy, but sometimes that process goes wrong and that's cancer. Um, the cells are aging. Your skin may change color, developed wrinkles as you, as you age. And all of this is determined by these processes, all these proteins being produced, transported to various parts of the cells, binding to each other. And, and in our initial state about biology, we didn't even know that these cells existed. We had to invent microscopes to observe the cells. We had to, uh, we had to invent more powerful microscopes to see, you know, below the level of the cell to the level of molecules. We had to invent X -ray crystallography to see the DNA. We had to invent gene sequencing to read the DNA. Now, you know, we had to invent protein folding technology to, you know, to predict how it would fold and how they bind and how these things bind to each other, uh, you know, we had to, we had to invent various techniques for now. We can edit the G the DNA as of, you know, with CRISPR as of the last, uh, 12 years. So the, the whole history of biology, a whole big part of the history is, is basically our, our, our, our ability to read and understand what's going on and our ability to reach in and selectively change things. Um, and, and my view is that there's so much more we can still do there, right? You can do CRISPR, but you can do it for your whole body. Um, let's say I want to do it for one particular type of cell and I want the rate of targeting the wrong cell to be very low, that's still a challenge. That's still things people are working on. That's what we might need for gene therapy for certain diseases. And so the reason I'm saying all of this and it goes beyond, you know, beyond this to, you know, to gene sequencing, to new types of nanomaterials for observing what's going on inside cells for, you know, antibody drug conjugates. The reason I'm saying all of this is that this could be a leverage point for the AI systems, right? That the number of such inventions, it's, it's in the, it's in the mid double digits or something, you know, mid double digits, maybe low triple digits over the history of biology. Let's say I have a million of these AIs, like, you know, can they discover a thousand, you know, working together? Can they discover thousands of these very quickly? And, and does that provide a huge lever instead of trying to leverage the, you know, 2 trillion a year we spend on, you know, Medicare or whatever, can we leverage the 1 billion a year that's, that's, you know, that's spent to discover, but with much higher quality. Um, and so what, what is it like, you know, being a, being a scientist that works with, uh, with, with an AI system? The way I think about it actually is, well, so I think in the early stages, uh, the AIs are going to be like grad students. You're going to give them a project. You're going to say, you know, I'm the experienced biologist. I've set up the lab, the biology professor, or even the grad students themselves will say, here's, here's what, uh, here's what you can do with an AI, you know, like AI system, I'd like to study this and, you know, the AI system, it has all the tools it can like, look up all the literature to decide what to do. It can look at all the equipment. It can go to a website and say, Hey, I'm going to go to, you know, Thermo Fisher or, you know, whatever the lab equipment company is dominant lab equipment company is today in my, my time. It was Thermo Fisher. Um, uh, you know, I'm, I'm going to order this new equipment to, to, to do this. I'm going to run my experiments. I'm going to, you know, write up a report about my experiments. I'm going to, you know, inspect the images for contamination. I'm going to decide what the next experiment is. I'm going to like write some code and run a statistical analysis. All the things that grad student would do. There'll be a computer with an AI that like the professor talks to every once in a while, and it says, this is what you're going to do today. The AI system comes to it with questions. Um, when it's necessary to run the lab equipment, it may be limited in some ways. It may have to hire a human lab assistant to, you know, to do the experiment and explain how to do it, or it could, you know, it could use advances in lab automation that are gradually being developed over, you have been developed over the last, uh, uh, decade or so. And we'll, we'll continue to be, we'll continue to be developed. Uh, and so it will look like there's a human professor and a thousand AI grad students, and you know, if you, if you go to one of these Nobel prize winning biologists or so you'll say, okay, well, you, you know, you had like 50 grad students, well, now you have a thousand and they're, they're, they're smarter than you are, by the way. Um, uh, then I think at some point it'll flip around where the, you know, the AI systems will, you know, will, will be the PIs will be the leaders and, and, and, you know, there'll be, there'll be ordering humans or other AI systems around. So I think that's how it will work on the research side. And they would be the inventors of a CRISPR type technology. They would be the inventors of, of a CRISPR type technology. Um, and then I think, you know, as I say in the essay, we'll want to turn, turn, probably turning loose is the wrong, the wrong term, but we'll want to, we'll want to harness the AI systems, uh, to improve the clinical trial system as well. There's some amount of this that's regulatory. That's a matter of societal decisions and that'll be harder, but can we get better at predicting the results of clinical trials? Can we get better at statistical design so that what, you know, clinical trials that used to require, you know, 5 ,000 people and therefore, you know, needed a hundred million dollars in a year to enroll them now they need 500 people in two months to enroll them. Um, that's where we should start. Uh, and, and, you know, can we increase the success rate of clinical trials by doing things in animal trials that we used to do in clinical trials and doing things in simulations that we used to do in animal trials, again, we won't be able to simulate it all, AI is not God. Um, uh, but, but, you know, can we, can we shift the curve substantially and radically? So I don't know, that would be my picture.

02:29:16 Speaker 4: Doing in vitro and doing it. I mean, you're still slowed down. It still takes time, but you can do it much, much faster. Yeah.

02:29:22 Speaker 3: Yeah. Can we just one step at a time and, and can that, can that add up to a lot of steps, even though, even though we still need clinical trials, even though we still need laws, even though the FDA and other organizations will still not be perfect, can we just move everything in a positive direction? And when you add up all those positive directions, do you get everything that was going to happen from here to 2100 instead happens from 2027 to 2032 or something?

02:29:47 Speaker 4: Another way that I think the world might be changing with AI even today, but moving towards this future of the, the powerful, super useful AI is programming. So how do you see the nature of programming? Because it's so intimate to the actual act of building AI. How do you see that changing for us humans?

02:30:09 Speaker 3: I think that's going to be one of the areas that changes fastest, um, for two reasons, one programming is a skill that's very close to the actual building of the AI. Um, so the farther a skill is from the people who are building the AI, the longer it's going to take to get disrupted by the AI, right? Like I truly believe that like AI will disrupt agriculture. Maybe it already has in some ways, but that's just very distant from the folks who are building AI. And so I think it's going to take longer, but programming is the bread and butter of, you know, a large fraction of, of the employees who work at Anthropic and at the other companies. And so it's going to happen fast. The other reason it's going to happen fast is with programming. You close the loop, both when you're training the model, when you're applying the model, the idea that the model can write the code means that the model can then run the code and, and, and then see the results and, and interpret it back. And so it really has an ability, unlike hardware, unlike biology, which we just discussed, the model has an ability to close the loop. Um, and, and so I think those two things are going to lead to the model getting good at programming very fast. As I saw on, you know, typical real world programming tasks, models have gone from 3 % in January of this year to 50 % in October of this year. So, you know, we're on that S curve, right? Where it's going to start slowing down soon because you can only get to a hundred percent, but, uh, I, you know, I, I would guess that in another 10 months we'll, we'll probably get pretty close. We'll be at at least 90%. So again, I would guess, you know, I don't know how long it'll take, but I would guess again, 2026, 2027 Twitter people who crop out my, who, who, who crop out these, these numbers and get rid of the caveats, like, like, I don't know. I don't like you go away. Uh, I would guess that the kind of task that the vast majority of coders do AI can probably, if we make the task very narrow, like just write code. Um, AI systems will, uh, be able to do that. Now that said, I think comparative advantage is powerful. We'll find that when AIs can do 80 % of a coder's job, including most of it, that's literally like write code with a given spec, we'll find that the remaining parts of the job become more leveraged for humans, right? Humans will, there'll be more about like high level system design or, you know, looking at the app and like, is it architected well? And the, the design and UX aspects and eventually AI will be able to do those as well, right? That's my vision of the, you know, powerful AI system. But I think for much longer than we might expect, we will see that, uh, small parts of the job that humans still do will expand to fill their entire job in order for the overall productivity to go up. Um, that's something we've seen, you know, it used to be that, you know, writing, you know, writing and editing letters was very difficult. And like writing the print was difficult. Well, as soon as you had word processors and then, and then, uh, and then computers and it became easy to produce work and easy to share it, then, then that became instant and all the focus was on, was on the ideas. So this, this logic of comparative advantage that expands tiny parts of the tasks to large parts of the tasks and creates new tasks in order to expand productivity. I think that's going to be the case. Again, someday AI will be better at everything. And that logic won't apply. And then, then we all have, you know, humanity will have to think about how to collectively deal with that. And we're thinking about that every day. Um, uh, and you know, that's another one of the grand problems to deal with aside from misuse and autonomy. And, you know, we should take it very seriously, but I think, I think in the, in the near term and maybe even in the medium term, like medium term, like two, three, four years. You know, I expect that humans will continue to have a huge role in the nature of programming will change, but programming as a, as a role programming as a job will not change. It'll just be less writing things line by line and it'll be more macroscopic.

02:34:10 Speaker 4: And I wonder what the future of IDEs looks like. So the tooling of interacting with AI systems, this is true for programming and also probably true for, in other contexts, like computer use, but maybe domain specific, like we mentioned biology, it probably needs its own tooling about how to be effective. And then programming needs its own tooling. Is anthropic going to play in that space of also tooling potentially?

02:34:30 Speaker 3: I'm absolutely convinced that powerful IDEs that, that there's so much low hanging fruit to be grabbed there. That, you know, right now it's just like you talk to the model and it talks back, but, but look, I mean, IDEs are great at kind of lots of static analysis of, of, you know, so much as possible with kind of static analysis, like many bugs you can find without even writing the code. Then, you know, IDEs are good for running particular things, organizing your code, measuring coverage of unit tests. Like there's so much that's been possible with a normal, with a normal IDEs. Now you add something like, well, the model now, you know, the model can now like write code and run code. Like I am absolutely convinced that over the next year or two, even if the quality of the models didn't improve, that there would be enormous opportunity to enhance people's productivity by catching a bunch of mistakes, doing a bunch of grunt work for people, and that we haven't even scratched the surface. Anthropic itself. I mean, you can't say, you know, no, you know, it's hard to say what will happen in the future. Currently, we're not trying to make such IDEs ourself, rather we're powering the companies like Cursor or like Cognition or some of the other, you know, Expo in the security space. You know, others that I can mention as well that are building such things themselves on top of our API. And our view has been let a thousand flowers bloom. We don't internally have the, you know, the resources to try all of these different things. Let's let our customers try it. And, you know, we'll see who succeeds and maybe different customers will succeed in different ways. So I both think this is super promising and, you know, it's not, it's not, it's not something, you know, Anthropic isn't, isn't eager to, at least right now, compete with all our companies in this space and maybe never. Yeah.

02:36:27 Speaker 4: It's been interesting to watch Cursor try to integrate Cloud successfully because there's, it's actually fascinating how many places it can help the programming experience. It's not as trivial. It is, it is really astounding.

02:36:38 Speaker 3: I feel like, you know, as a CEO, I don't get to program that much. And I feel like if six months from now, I go back, it'll be completely unrecognizable to me. Exactly.

02:36:46 Speaker 4: Um, so in this world with super powerful AI, uh, that's increasingly automated. What's the source of meaning for us humans? Work is a source of deep meaning for many of us. So what do we, uh, where do we find the meaning?

02:37:01 Speaker 3: This is something that I've, I've written about a little bit in the essay, although I, I actually, I give it a bit short shrift, not for any, um, not for any principled reason, but this essay, if you believe it was originally going to be two or three pages, I was going to talk about it at all hands. And the reason I, I, I realized it was an under, unimportant, underexplored topic is that I just kept writing things and I was just like, oh man, I can't do this justice. And so the thing ballooned to like 40 or 50 pages. And then when I got to the work and meaning section, I'm like, oh man, this isn't going to be a hundred pages. Like I'm going to have to write a whole other essay about that. But meaning is actually interesting because you think about like the life that someone lives or something, or like, you know, like, you know, let's say you were to put me in like a, I don't know, like a simulated environment or something where like, um, you know, like I have a job and I'm trying to accomplish things and I don't know. I like do that for 60 years. And then, then you're like, oh, oh, like, oops, this was, this was actually all a game. Right. Does that really kind of rob you of the meaning of the whole thing? You know, like I still made important choices, including moral choices. I still sacrificed. I still had to kind of gain all these skills or, or, or just like a similar exercise, you know, think back to like, you know, one of the historical figures who, you know, discovered electromagnetism or relativity or something. If you told them, well, actually 20 ,000 years ago, some, some alien on, you know, some alien on this planet discovered this before, before you did. Um, does that, does that rob the meaning of the discovery? It doesn't really seem like it to me. Right. It seems like the process is what is what matters and how it shows who you are as a person along the way. And you know, how you relate to other people and like the decisions that you make along the way. Those are, those are consequential. Um, you know, I, I could imagine if we handle things badly in an AI world, we could set things up where people don't have any long -term source of meaning or any, but, but that's, that's more a choice, a set of choices we make. That's more a set of the architecture of a society with these powerful models. If we, if we design it badly and for shallow things, then, then that might happen, I would also say that, you know, most people's lives today, while admirably, you know, they work very hard to find meaning, meaning those lives. Like, look, you know, we, who are privileged and who are developed means technologies, we should have empathy for people, not just here, but in the rest of the world who, who, you know, spend a lot of their time kind of scraping by to, to, to, to, to like survive, assuming we can distribute the benefits of these technology, of this technology to everywhere. Like their lives are going to get a hell of a lot better. Um, and, uh, you know, meaning will be important to them as it is important to them now, but, but, you know, we should not forget the importance of that. And, and, you know, that, that, uh, the idea of meaning as, as, as, as kind of the only important thing is in some ways, an artifact of, of a small subset of people who have, who have been, uh, economically fortunate, but I, you know, I think all that said, I, you know, I think a world is possible with powerful AI that not only has as much meaning for, for everyone, but that has, that has more meaning for everyone. Right. That can, can allow, um, can allow everyone to see worlds and experiences that it was either possible for no one to see or, or possible for, for very few people to experience. Um, so I, I am optimistic about meaning. I worry about economics and the concentration of power. That's actually what I worry about more. Um, I, I worry about how do we make sure that that fair world reaches everyone. Um, when things have gone wrong for humans, they've often gone wrong because humans mistreat other humans. Uh, that, that is maybe in some ways, even more than the autonomous risk of AI or the question of meaning that, that is the thing I worry about most. Um, the, the concentration of power, the abuse of power, um, structures like autocracies and dictatorships where a small number of people exploits a large number of people. I'm very worried about that.

02:41:08 Speaker 4: And AI increases the amount of power in the world. And if you concentrate that power and abuse that power, it can do immeasurable damage. Yes.

02:41:17 Speaker 3: It's very frightening. It's very, it's very frightening.

02:41:20 Speaker 4: Well, I encourage people, highly encourage people to read the full essay. That should probably be a book or a sequence of essays. Um, because it does paint a very specific future. I could tell the later sections got shorter and shorter because you started to probably realize that this is going to be a very long essay.

02:41:36 Speaker 3: I, one, I realized it would be very long and two, I'm very aware of and very much try to avoid, um, you know, just, just being, uh, I don't know, I don't know what the term for it is, but one, one of these people who's kind of overconfident and has an opinion on everything and kind of says, says a bunch of stuff and isn't, isn't an expert, I very much tried to avoid that, but I have to admit, once I got the biology sections, like I wasn't an expert. And so as much as I expressed uncertainty, uh, probably I said some, a bunch of things that were embarrassing or wrong.

02:42:06 Speaker 4: Well, I was excited for the future you painted and, uh, thank you so much for working hard to build that future.

02:42:11 Speaker 3: And thank you for talking to me. Thanks for having me. I just, I just hope we can get it right and, and make it real. And if there's one message I want to, I want to send, it's that to get all this stuff right, to make it real, we, we both need to build the technology, build the, you know, the companies, the economy around using this technology positively, but we also need to address the risks because they're, they're, those risks are in our way. They're, they're landmines on, on the way from here to there. And we have to diffuse those landmines if we want to get there.

02:42:41 Speaker 4: It's a balance, like all things in life, like all things. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Daria Amadei. And now, dear friends, here's Amanda Askell. You are a philosopher by training. So what sort of questions did you find fascinating through your journey in philosophy in Oxford and NYU, and then, uh, switching over to the AI problems at OpenAI and Anthropic?

02:43:07 Speaker 1: I think philosophy is actually a really good subject if you are kind of fascinated with everything. So, cause there's a philosophy of everything, you know, so if you do philosophy of mathematics for a while, and then you decide that you're actually really interested in chemistry, you can do philosophy of chemistry for a while. You can move into ethics or philosophy of politics. Um, I think towards the end I was really interested in ethics primarily. Um, so that was like what my PhD was on. It was on a kind of technical area of ethics, which was ethics where worlds contain infinitely many people, strangely, a little bit less practical on the end of ethics, and then I think that one of the tricky things with doing a PhD in ethics is that you're thinking a lot about like the world, how it could be better problems. And you're doing like a PhD in philosophy. And I think when I was doing my PhD, I was kind of like, this is really interesting. It's probably one of the most fascinating questions I've ever encountered in philosophy. Um, and I love it, but I would rather see if I can have an impact on the world and seeing if I can like do good things. And I think that was around the time that AI was still probably not as widely recognized as it is now. That was around 2017, 2018. I had been following progress and it seemed like it was becoming kind of a big deal. And I was basically just happy to get involved and see if I could help. Cause I was like, well, if you try and do something impactful, if you don't succeed, you tried to do the impactful thing and you can go be a scholar and like not feel like you, you know, you tried. Um, and if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. Um, and so then I went into AI policy at that point.

02:44:46 Speaker 4: And what does AI policy entail?

02:44:48 Speaker 1: At the time, this was more thinking about sort of the political impact and the ramifications of AI. Um, and then I slowly moved into sort of, uh, AI evaluation, how we evaluate models, how they compare to each other.
